<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</a></h2>


<p>Early American history is especially suited for "source
work" in secondary schools and undergraduate college classes.
After the year 1800, there are too many documents and many
of them are too long. The student can get no systematic survey
nor any sense of continuity; and source work is therefore
merely illustrative of particular incidents. But, for the early
period, it is possible, by careful selection and exclusion, to lay
a basis for a fairly connected study.</p>

<p>To do this, it is necessary to combine in one volume selections
which are usually grouped separately, as "Documents"
and as "Readings,"&mdash;such, for instance, as the Massachusetts
charter, on the one hand, and Winthrop's letters to his wife,
on the other. Rigid scholarship may object to the inclusion
of such different sorts of sources between the same covers.
But students cannot be expected to own or use more than one
volume of sources in American history; and the practical educational
advantages of the combination seem to me to outweigh
all possible objections&mdash;besides which, something might be
said for the arrangement in itself, for young students, on the
side of interest and convenience.</p>

<p>A number of admirable collections of sources for schools are
already in use. And yet, in preparing my <i>American History
and Government</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I found no single volume which contained
the different kinds of source material desirable for illustration,
while much of the most valuable material was still inaccessible
in any collection. Some two-thirds of the selections in the
present volume, I believe, have not previously appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
Source Books; and, for many of the customary documents, I
have found it desirable to print parts not usually given. Thus,
for Gorges' Patent for Maine, instead of reproducing the territorial
grant (which is all that is given in the only Source
Book which touches on that document), I have chosen rather
to give the portion authorizing a degree of popular self-government
(the reference to the "parliament in New England").</p>

<p>In a few cases, documents which might have been expected
are not given, because extracts from them are used freely in
the <i>American History and Government</i>, to which this is a companion
volume. The most important cases of this character
are noted at appropriate points. In general, in the selection
and arrangement of documents, special emphasis has been
given to the following topics: (1) the idealistic motives back
of American colonization in Virginia as well as in Puritan
New England; (2) the evolution of political institutions in
Virginia and in typical Northern colonies,&mdash;especially of representative
government and of the town meeting, and of such
details as the use of the ballot; (3) the very imperfect nature
of democracy, political and social, in colonial America,&mdash;so
that the student may better appreciate our later growth;
(4) social conditions,&mdash;necessarily a rather fragmentary treatment;
(5) the evolution of commonwealths out of colonies in
the Revolution; and (6) the breakdown of the Confederation
and the making of the Constitution.</p>

<p>Many typical documents are given entire. Other selections
are excerpted carefully. In such cases, omissions are indicated,
of course, and the substance of the omitted matter is
usually indicated in brackets. In the case of a few selections,
like those from Winthrop's <i>History</i>, the original document has
already been published in standard editions with modernized
spelling. Such editions have been followed. The text of all
other documents has been reproduced faithfully, except for
such departures as are authorized in the American Historical
Association's <i>Suggestions for the Printing of Documents</i>; <i>i.e.</i>,
regarding the spelling out of abbreviations, and the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
usage for the consonantal <i>i</i> and <i>u</i>, and the modernizing of
punctuation when absolutely needful to prevent ambiguity.
Some students may find a slight difficulty at first in the
vagaries of seventeenth century orthography. But this difficulty
is quickly surmounted; and, apart from the added flavor
that comes from the quaintness of the original, and from the
consciousness that the copy has been strictly adhered to, there
is often a distinct historical advantage in the practice. The
falling away in book-culture in the second generation of New
England colonization can hardly be suggested so forcibly in
any other way as by following the degeneration of spelling by
town officials&mdash;as in the Watertown records in Number 83.
The peculiarities of type in printed documents have been preserved
so far as possible, but here I have taken a greater
liberty than in any other matter of this kind. Italics and
black-faced type have been introduced freely, to call attention
to matter of special importance for instruction. Sometimes
this practice has been noted in the respective introductions;
and in other cases there will be little difficulty in deciding
which passages owe their prominence of this sort to the editor.</p>

<p>I have tried also to add to the teaching value of the book
by a free use of introductions to the various extracts, and
by footnotes and addenda, with occasional "Hints for Study."</p>

<h4>1. Classes of Englishmen</h4>

<p>William Harrison, in Holinshed's <i>Chronicle</i> (1577). Cf. No. 75 on like
social divisions in early New England; and see <i>American History and
Government</i>, &sect; 65.</p>

<p>We in England divide our people commonlie into foure
sorts, as gentlemen, citizens or burgesses, yeomen, ... or
[and] laborers. Of gentlemen the first and cheefe (next the
king) be the prince, dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, and
barons: and these are called gentlemen of the greater sort, or
(as our common usage of speech is) lords and noblemen: and
next unto them be knights, esquiers, and last of all they that
are simplie called gentlemen, ... Who soever studieth the
lawes of the realme, who so abideth in the universitie giving
his mind to his booke, or professeth physicke and the liberall
sciences, or beside his service in the roome of a capteine in the
warres, or good counsell given at home, whereby his commonwealth
is benefited, can live without manuell labour, and
thereto is able and will beare the port, charge, and countenance
of a gentleman, he shall for monie have a cote and armes
bestowed upon him by heralds (who in the charter of the same
doo of custome pretend antiquitie and service, and manie gaie
things) and, thereunto being made so good cheape, be called
master, which is the title that men give to esquiers and gentlemen,
and reputed for a gentleman ever after....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>... our merchants [are] to be installed, as amongst the
citizens (although they often change estate with gentlemen, as
gentlemen doo with them, by a mutuall conversion of the one
into the other)....</p>

<p>Yeomen are ... free men, borne English, and [who] may
dispend of their owne free land in yearelie revenue, to the
summe of fortie shillings sterling, or six pounds as monie goeth
in our times. ... This sort of people have a certeine preheminence,
and more estimation than labourers and the common
sort of artificers, and commonlie live wealthilie, keepe
good houses, and travell to get riches. They are also for the
most part farmers to gentlemen ... or at the leastwise artificers,
and with grasing, frequenting of markets, and keeping
of servants (not idle servants as the gentlemen doo, but such as
get both their owne and part of their master's living) do come
to great welth, in somuch that manie of them are able and doo
buie the lands of unthriftie gentlemen, and often setting their
sonnes to the schooles, to the universities, and to the Ins of
the court, or otherwise leaving them sufficient lands whereupon
they may live without labour, doo make them by those means
to become gentlemen. <i>These were they that in times past made
all France afraid. ...</i></p>

<p>The fourth and last sort of people in England are daie
labourers, poore husbandmen, and some retailers (which have
no free land) copie holders, and all artificers,&mdash;as tailers,
shomakers, carpenters, brickmakers, masons, etc. As for
slaves and bondmen we have none, naie such is the privilege
of our countrie by the especiall grace of God, and bountie of
our princes, that if anie come hither from other realms, so
soone as they set foot on land they become so free of condition
as their masters. ... This fourth and last sort of people
therefore have neither voice nor authoritie in the common
wealth, but are to be ruled, and not to rule other; yet they
are not altogither neglected, for in cities and corporat townes,
for default of yeomen they are faine to make up their inquests
[juries] of such maner of people. And in villages they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
commonlie made churchwardens, sidemen, aleconners, now and
then constables, and manie times injoie the name of hedboroughes.
Unto this sort also may our great swarmes of idle
serving men be referred, of whome there runneth a proverbe;
'Young serving men, old beggers,' bicause service is none
heritage....</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Peckham was a partner in Gilbert's enterprise. His <i>Report</i>, a considerable
pamphlet, was written in 1582.</p></div>

<p>... To conclude, since by Christian dutie we stand bound
chiefly to further all such acts as do tend to the encreasing the
true flock of Christ by reducing into the right way those lost
sheepe which are yet astray: And that we shall therein follow
the example of our right vertuous predecessors of renowned
memorie, and leave unto our posteritie a divine memoriall of so
godly an enterprise: Let us, I say, for the considerations alledged,
enter into judgement with our selves, whether this
action may belong to us or no. ... Then shal her Majesties
dominions be enlarged, her highnesse ancient titles justly confirmed,
all odious idlenesse from this our Realme utterly
banished, divers decayed townes repaired, and many poor and
needy persons relieved, and estates of such as now live in
want shail be embettered, the ignorant and barbarous idolaters
taught to know Christ, the innocent defended from their bloodie
tyrannical neighbours, the diabolicall custome of sacrificing
humane creatures abolished....</p>

Queen Elizabeth. It fills 107 pages of the volume of the Maine collections.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nowe the meanes to sende suche as shall labour effectually
in this busines ys, by plantinge one or tuoo colonies of our
nation upon that fyrme, where they may remaine in safetie,
and firste learne the language of the people nere adjoyninge
(the gifte of tongues beinge nowe taken awaye), and by little

preachers to come unto them rashly with oute some suche
preparation for their safetie, yt were nothinge els but to
ronne to their apparaunte and certaine destruction, as yt happened

churche because they have bene the onely converters of many
millions of infidells to Christianttie. Yea, I myselfe have
bene demannded of them, how many infidells have been by us
converted? ... Yet in very deede I was not able to name
any one infidell by them converted. But God, quoth I, hath
his tyme for all men, whoe calleth some at the nynthe, and
some at the eleventh houer. And if it please him to move the

Adventurers for the plantation of Virginea, all happie and prosperous
successe, which may either augment your glorie, or increase
your wealth, or purchase your eternitie.</i></p>

<p>Time ... consumes both man and his memorie. It is not
brasse nor marble that can perpetuate immortalitie of name
upon the earth. [But] A right sure foundation ... have
you (My Lords and the rest of the most Worthie Adventurers
for Virginia) laid for the immortalitie of your names and
memorie, which, for the advancement of Gods glorie, the renowne
of his Majestie, and the good of your Countrie, have
undertaken so honourable a project, as all posterities shall
blesse: and Uphold your names and memories so long as the
Sunne and Moone endureth: Whereas they which preferre
their money before vertue, their pleasure before honour, and
their sensuall securitie before heroicall adventures, shall
perish with their money, die with their pleasures, and be buried
in everlasting forgetfulnes....</p>

<p>And therefore we may justly say, as the children of Israel
say here to Joshua, we are a great people, and the lande is too
narrow for us; so that whatsoever we have beene, now it behooves
us to be both prudent and politicke, and not to deride
and reject good powers of profitable and gainefull expectation;
but rather to embrace every occasion which hath any probabilitie
in its future hopes: And seeing there is neither preferment
nor employment for all within the lists of our Countrey, we
might justly be accounted as in former times, both imprudent
and improvident, if we will yet sit with our armes foulded on
our bosomes, and not rather seeke after such adventers whereby
the Glory of God may be advanced, the teritories of our
Kingdome inlarged, our people both preferred and employed
abroad, our wants supplyed at home, His Majesties customes
wonderfully augmented, and the honour and renown of our
Nation spread and propagated to the ends of the World....</p>

<p>The report goeth, that in Virginia the people are savage and
incredibly rude, they worship the divell, offer their young
children in sacrifice unto him, wander up and downe like beasts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and in manners and conditions, differ very little from beasts,
having no Art, nor science, nor trade, to imploy themselves, or
give themselves unto, yet by nature loving and gentle, and
desirous to imbrace a better condition. Oh how happy were
that man which could reduce this people from brutishness to
civilitie, to religion, to Christianitie, to the saving of their
souls....</p>

<p>Farre be it from the hearts of the English, they should give
any cause to the world to say that they sought the wealth of
that Countrie above or before the glorie of God, and the propagation
of his Kingdome.</p>

<p>Their second objection is [the argument of opponents of
colonization] that this age will see no profit of this plantation.
Which objection admit it were true, yet it is too brutish, and
bewraies their neglect and incurious respect of posteritie: we
are not borne like beasts for ourselves, and the time present
only. ... What benefit or comfort should we have enjoyed in
things of this world, if our forefathers had not provided better
for us, and bin more carefully respective of posteritie than for
themselves? We sow, we set, we build, not so much for ourselves
as for posteritie; ... They which onely are for themselves,
shall die in themselves, and shall not have a name
among posterity; their rootes shall be dried up beneath, and
above shall their branches bee cut down, their remembrance
shall perish from the earth, and they shall have no name in
the street. Job xviii; 16, 17.</p>

<p>Others object to the continuall charges [assessments] which
will prove in their opinion very heavie and burdensome to
those that shall undertake the said Plantation. These like
the dog in the manger, neither eate hay themselves, neither
will they suffer the Oxe that would. They never think any
charge too much that may any way increase their owne private
estate. They have thousands to bestow about the ingrossing
of a commoditie, or upon a morgage, or to take their neighbors
house over his head, or to lend upon usurie; but if it come to
a publicke good, they grone under the least burden of charges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
that can bee required of them. <b><i>These men should be used like
sponges; they must be squeased, seeing they drink up all</i></b>, and will
yeeld to nothing, though it concerne the common good never
so greatly. But it is demonstratively prooved in Nova Britannia,
that the charges about this Plantation will be nothing,
in comparison of the benefit that will grow thereof. And
what notable thing I pray you can be brought to passe without
charges? ... <b><i>Without question, he that saves his money</i></b>, where
Gods glory is to be advanced, Christian religion propagated
and planted, the good of the commonwealth increased, and the
glorious renowne of the King inlarged is subject to the curse
of Simon Magus, <b><i>his money and he are in danger to perish together</i></b>.
Let none therefore find delaies, or faine excuses to withhold
them from this imployment for Virginia, seeing every opposition
against it is an opposition against God, the King, the Church,
and the Commonwealth....</p>


<h4>6. Nova Britannia, 1609</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Peter Force's <i>Historical Tracts</i>, I (Washington, 1836).</p>

<p>This tract of some 12,000 words (equivalent to thirty-five pages of this
volume) was written in 1609 for the same purpose as No. 5 above.</p></div>

<p>So I wish and intreat all well affected subjects, some in their
persons, others in their purses, cheerefully to adventure, and
joyntly take in hand this high and acceptable worke, tending
to advance and spread the kingdome of God, and the knowledge
of the truth, among so many millions of men and women,
Savage and blind, that never yet saw the true light shine before
their eyes ... as also for the honor of our King, and
enlarging of his kingdome, and for preservation and defence of
that small number our friends and countrimen already planted,
least for want of more supplies we become a scorne to the
world, subjecting our former adventures to apparent spoile and
hazard, and our people (as a prey) to be sackt and puld out of
possession, as were the French out of <i>Nova Francia</i>, not many
yeares ago; and, <i>which is the lest and last respect</i> (yet usuallie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
preferred), for the singular good and benefite that will undoubtedly
arise to this whole nation, and to everie one of us in
particular, that will adventure therein.</p>

<p>It is knowne to the world [reference to attempts of Raleigh
and Gilbert] how the present generation, scorning to sit
downe by their losses, made newe attempts, not induring to
looke on whilst so huge and spacious countries (the fourth
part of the world) and the greatest and wealthiest part of all
the rest, should remain a wilderness, subject (for the most
part) but to wild beasts and fowles of the ayre, and to savage
people, which have no Christian nor civill use of any thing;
and that the subjects onely of one Prince <i>Christian</i> [Spaniards],
which but within the memorie of man began first to creepe
upon the face of those Territories, and now by meanes of their
remnants settled here and there, do therefore imagine the
world to be theirs, shouldring out all other nations, accounting
themselves Kings and Commanders, not onely in townes and
places where they have planted, but over all other partes of
<i>America</i>, which containe sundrie vast and barbarous Regions,
many of which (to this day) they never knew, nor did ever
setle foote therein: which notwithstanding, if it were yeelded
them as due, yet their strength and meanes, farre inferiour to
their aspires, will never stretch to compasse ... the hundredth
part.</p>

<p>But seeing we so passed by their dwellings, that in seating
ourselves, wee sought not to unsettle them, but by Gods mercy,
after many stormes, were brought to the Coast of another
countrie, farre distant and remote from their habitations: why
should any frowne or envie at it; or if they doe, why should
wee (neglecting so faire an opportunitie) faint or feare to enlarge
our selves? Where is our force and auncient vigour?
Doth our late reputation sleepe in the dust? No, no, let not
the world deceive it selfe; we still remaine the same, and upon
just occasion given, we shall quickly shew it too:</p>

<p>... But wee must beware that ... that bitter root of
greedy gaine be not so settled in our harts, that beeing in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
golden dreame, if it fall not out presently to our expectation,
we slinke away with discontent, and draw our purses from the
charge. If any shew this affection, I would wish his baseness
of minde to be noted. What must be our direction then? No
more but this: if thou dost once approve the worke, lay thy
hand to it cheerfully, and withdraw it not till thy taske bee
done. In all assayes and new supplies of money be not lagge,
nor like a dull horse thats alwaies in the lash; for heere lies
the poison of all good attempts, when as men without halling
and pulling, will not be drawne to performance, for by this,
others are discouraged, the action lies undone, and the first
expence is lost: But are wee to looke for no gaine in the lewe
of all adventures? Yes undoubtedly, there is assured hope of
gaine, as I will shew anon in due place; <i>but look it be not
chiefe in your thoughts</i>. God, that hath said by <i>Solomon</i>: <i>Cast
thy bread upon the waters, and after many daies thou shalt find
it</i>: he will give the blessing.</p>

<p>... Two things are especially required herein, <i>people</i> to
make the plantation, and <i>money</i> to furnish our present provisions
and shippings now in hand: For the first, wee neede
not doubt, our land abounding with swarmes of idle persons,
which having no meanes of labour to releeve their misery, doe
likewise swarme in lewd and naughtie practises, so that if we
seeke not some waies for their forreine employment, wee must
provide shortly more prisons and corrections for their bad
conditions, for it fares with populous common weales as with
plants and trees that bee too frolicke, which not able to sustaine
and feede their multitude of branches, doe admit an
engrafting of their buds and sciences into some other soile,
accounting it a benefite for preservation of their kind, and a
disburdening their stocke of those superfluous twigs that suck
away their nourishment.</p>

<p>... If all these be yet too weake to confirm the doubtfull,
or awake the drousie, then let us come nearer, and arise from
their <i>reasons</i> and <i>affections</i> to their <i>soules</i> and <i>consciences</i>:
remember that what was at first but of <i>conveniency</i>, and for

consider, that they have promised to adventure and not performed
it; that they have encouraged and exposed many of

<i>Bretheren</i> by our common mother the <i>Church</i>, Christians of one
<i>Faith</i> and one <i>Baptisme</i>, to a miserable and inevitable death.
Let not any man flatter himself, that it concernes not him, for
he that forsakes whome he may safely releeve, is as guilty of
his death as he that can swim, and forsakes himself by refusing,
is of his owne. Let every man look inward, and disperse
that cloud of avarice, which darkeneth his spiritual sight and
he will finde there that when he shall appeare before the

done? Hath he fed and clothed the hungry and naked? It
shall be required, what he hath done for the advancement of
that Gospell which hath saved him; and for the releefe of his

<h4>8. Marston's "Eastward Hoe"</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Marston published this play in 1605 to caricature the intended
Virginian colonization. The name is a survival of the idea that Columbus
had found the East. In the extract, the mate, Sea Gull, at a tavern
meeting, is persuading some young blades to embark for the venture.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Sea Gull.</i> Come boyes, Virginia longs till we share the
rest of her....</p>

<p><i>Spendall.</i> Why, is she inhabited alreadie with any English?</p>

<p><i>Sea Gull.</i> A whole countrie of English is there, men bread
of those that were left there in '79 [Ralegh's colony of '87 is
meant]; they have married with the Indians ... [who] are
so in love with them that all the treasure they have they lay
at their feete.</p>

<p><i>Scape Thrift.</i> But is there such treasure there, Captaine ...?</p>

<p><i>Sea Gull.</i> I tell thee, golde is more plentifull there then
copper is with us; and for as much redde copper as I can
bring, Ile have thrise the waight in gold. Why, man, all their
dripping pans ... are pure gould; and all the chaines with
which they chaine up their streets are massie gold; all the
prisoners they take are fettered in gold; and for rubies and
diamonds they goe forth on holydayes and gather 'em by the
seashore to hang on their childrens coates, and sticke in their
children's caps, as commonly as our children wear saffron-gilt
brooches. ... Besides, there wee shall have no more law than
consceince, and not too much of eyther.</p>


<h4>9. Crashaw's "Daily Prayer"</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Force's <i>Historical Tracts</i>, III (1844), page 67.</p>

<p>The ardent clerical advocates of expansion, like Hakluyt and Crashaw,
resented bitterly such "jests of prophane players" as No. 8 above; and
Crashaw retorted by this passage in his form for "A Prayer duly said
[at Jamestown] Morning and Evening ... either by the Captaine of the
watch himselfe, or by some one of his principall officers." This form
was drawn up in 1609, before Delaware's expedition, and was incorpo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>rated
afterward in Dale's Code of Laws. The prayer would fill some
twelve pages of this volume.</p></div>

<p>And whereas we have by undertaking this plantation undergone
the reproofs of a base world, insomuch that many of our
oune brethren laugh us to scorne, O Lord, we pray thee fortifie
us against this temptation. Let ... Papists and <i>players</i> and
such other ... scum and dregs of the earth, let them mocke
such as helpe to build up the wals of Jerusalem, and they that
be filthy, let them be filthy still; and let such swine still
wallow in their mire....</p>


<h4>10. Crashaw's Sermon, March 3/13, 1609/10</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Brown's <i>Genesis of the United States</i>, page 360 ff.</p>

<p>This sermon was preached before Lord Delaware's Expedition, on the
point of departure. The extract below was intended especially to refute
such insinuations as those in No. 8. Cf. also the introduction to No. 9.</p></div>

<p><i>Text (Luke 22-32). "But I have praied for thee that thy faith
faile not: therefore when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren."</i></p>

<p>Oh but those that goe in person are rakte up out of the
refuse, and are a number of disordered men, unfit to bring to
passe any good action: So indeed say those <b>that lie and slander</b>.
But I answer for the generalitie of them that goe, they be such
as offer themselves voluntarily ... and be like (for ought
that I see) to those [that] are left behind,&mdash;men of all sorts,
better and worse. But for manie that go in person, let these
objectors know, they be as good as themselves, and it may be,
many degrees better....</p>

<p>This enterprise hath only three enemies. 1. The Divell,
2. The Papists, and 3. The Players. [Then, after paying
respects to the first two] As for Plaiers: (pardon me, right
Honorable and beloved, for wronging this place and your
patience with so base a subject) they play with Princes and
Potentates, Magistrates, and Ministers, nay, with God and
Religion, and all holy things: nothing that is good, excellent,
or holy can escape them: how then can this action? But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
may suffice, that they are <i>Players</i>. They abuse Virginia, but
they are but <i>Players</i>: they disgrace it: true, but they are but
<i>Players</i>. ... The divell hates us, because wee purpose not to
suffer Heathens; and the Pope, because we have vowed to
tolerate no Papists. [Cf. Charter of 1609.] So doe the
Players, because wee resolve to suffer no Idle persons in
Virginea, which course, if it were taken in England, they know
<i>they</i> might turn to new occupations.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Dale wrote the following exhortation to Sir Thomas Smith,
"Treasurer" of the Company, on June 13/23, 1613. This extract was
read ten years later in a meeting of the Company.</p></div>

<p>Lett me tell you all at home this one thinge, and I pray
remember it,&mdash;if you give over this Country and loose it, you
with your wisedomes will leape such a gugion as our state
hath not done the like since they lost the Kingdome of ffraunce:
be not gulled with the clamorous reports of base people ...
if the glory of god hath noe power with them, and the conversion
of these poore Infidells, yet lett the rich Mammon's
desires egge them on to inhabite these Countries. I protest
unto you by the faith of an honest man, the more I range the
Country, the more I admire it. I have seene the best Countries
in Europe. I protest unto you before the Living God, put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
them altogether, this Country will be equivalent unto them if
it be inhabited with good people.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The <i>Records</i> continue, that, when this letter had been read, two
members added that they had heard Dale say "that in his judgment out

body gallantly against unjust charges.</p></div>

<p>This deare bought Land, with so much bloud and cost, hath
onely made some few rich, and all the rest losers [which fate,
however, does not deter their efforts, Smith explains] ...
For the Nobilitie and Gentrie, there is scarce any of them expects
anything but the prosperitie of the Action [success of
the colony]; and there are some Merchants ... I am confidently
persuaded, doe take more care and paines, nay, and at
their continuall great charge, than they could be hired to for
the love of money; so honestly regarding the generall good of
this great Worke, they would hold it worse than sacrilege to
wrong it but a shillinge.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Captain John Smith's <i>Works</i> (Birmingham edition), 935, 962.</p></div>

<p>... and what hath ever beene the worke of the best great
Princes of the world, but planting of Countries, and civilizing
barbarous and inhumane Nations to civility and humanity;
whose eternall actions fils our histories with more honour than
those that have wasted and consumed them by warres.</p>

<p>... the <i>Portugals</i> and <i>Spaniards</i> that first began plantations
in this unknowne world of <i>America</i> [their "everlasting
actions"] will testifie our idlenesse and ingratitude to all
posterity, and neglect of our duty and religion we owe our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
God, our King, and Countrey. ... Having as much power and
meanes as others, why should English men despaire, and not
doe as much as any? ... Seeing honour is our lives ambition,
and our ambition after death to have an honourable memory of
our life ... let us imitate their vertues, to be worthily their
successors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I speak not this to discourage any with vaine feares, but
could wish every English man to carry alwaies this Motto in
his heart,&mdash;Why should the brave Spanish Souldiers brag,
The Sunne never sets in the Spanish dominions, but ever
shineth on one part or other we have conquered for our King: ...
but to animate us to doe the like for ours, who is no way
his inferior.</p>

<p>And truly there is no pleasure comparable to a generous
spirit as good imploiment in noble actions, especially amongst
Turks, Heathens, and Infidels; to see daily new Countries,

comfort his friends, passe miseries, subdue enemies,
adventure upon any feazable danger for God and his Country.</p>

<p><b>Hints for Study.</b>&mdash;1. Observe that no exact district is granted; why?
2. Note the power of the proprietor: (<i>a</i>) to regulate settlement; (<i>b</i>) to
repel invasion; (<i>c</i>) to administer the government; (<i>d</i>) to make laws.
3. Note the guarantee of rights to the settlers; could it have been meant
to cover the "right to vote," when taken in connection with the rest of the
charter? 4. What church is established for the colony? Read and
criticise Fiske's amazing misstatement in <i>Old Virginia</i>, I, 31, regarding

of such a one as runneth farthest into the land, and if you
happen to discover divers portable rivers, and amongst them
any one that hath two main branches, if the difference be not
great, make choice of that which bendest most to the North-West,
<i>for that way you shall soonest find the other sea</i>.</p>

<p>When you have made choice of the river on which you mean
to settle, be not hasty in landing your victuals and munitions,
but first let Captain Newport discover how far that river may
be found navigable, that you make election of the strongest,
most wholesome and fertile place; for if you make many removes,
besides the loss of time, you shall greatly spoil your
victuals and your casks, and with great pain transport it in
small boats.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When you have discovered [explored] as far up the river
as you mean to plant yourselves, and landed your victuals and
munitions, to the end that every man may know his charge,
you shall do well to divide your six score men into three
parts, whereof one party of them you may appoint to fortifie
and build, of which your first work must be your store-house
for victual; the other you may imploy in preparing your
ground and sowing your corn and roots; [but] ten of these
forty you must leave as centinel at the haven's mouth. The
other forty you may imploy for two months in discovery of
the river above you, and on the country about you,...</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In all your passages you must have great care not to offend
the naturals, if you can eschew it, and imploy some few of
your company to trade with them for corn and all other lasting
victuals, if they have any, and this you must do before that
they perceive you mean to plant among them; for not being
sure how your own seed corn will prosper the first year, to
avoid the danger of famine, use and endeavour to store yourselves
of the country corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And how weary soever your soldiers be, let them never trust
the country people with the carriage of their weapons, for if
they run from you with your shott, which they only fear, they
will easily kill them all with their arrows. And whensoever
any of yours shoots before them, be sure that they be chosen
out of your best marksmen, for if they see your learners miss
what they aim at, they will think the weapon not so terrible,
and thereby will be bould to assault you.</p>

<p>Above all things do not advertize the killing of any of your
men, that the country people may know it; if they perceive
that they [you] are but common men, and that with the loss of
many of theirs, they may deminish any part of yours, they
will make many adventures upon you. If the country be
populous, you shall do well also not to let them see or know
of your sick men, if you have any, which may also encourage
them to many enterprises. You must take especial care that
you choose a seat for habitation that shall not be over burthened
with woods near your town, for all the men you have
shall not be able to cleanse twenty acres a year, besides that
it may serve for a covert for your enemies round about.</p>

<p>Neither must you plant in a low or moist place because
it will prove unhealthfull. You shall judge of the good air
by the people, for some part of that coast where the lands
are low have their people blear eyed, and with swollen bellies
and legs; but if the naturals be strong and clean made, it is
a true sign of a wholesome soil.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It were necessary that all your carpenters and other such
like workmen about building do first build your store house
and those other rooms of publick and necessary use before
any house be set up for any private persons; yet let them all
work together first for the company and then for private
men.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lastly and chiefly the way to prosper and achieve good success
is to make yourselves all of one mind for the good of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
your country and your own, and to serve and fear God the
Giver of all Goodness, for every plantation which our Heavenly
Father hath not planted shall be rooted out.</p>


<h4>19. Exploration and Sufferings</h4>


<h5><i>a. Percy's Discourse</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"That Honorable Gentleman, Master George Percy," wrote a detailed
narrative of the first months in Virginia. The manuscript is lost, but
extended extracts from it (such as would fill some twenty-five pages of
this volume) are preserved in the fourth volume of "Purchas his Pilgrimes"
(1625).</p></div>

<p>... The six and twentieth day of Aprill about foure a
clocke in the morning, wee descried the Land of Virginia: the
same day wee enterd into the Bay of Chesupioc without any
let or hinderance; there wee landed and discovered a little way,
but we could find nothing worth the speaking of but faire
meddowes and goodly tall Trees, with such Fresh-waters runninge
through the woods as I was almost ravished at the first
sight thereof.</p>

<p>At night, when wee were going aboard, there came the Savages
creeping upon all foure, from the Hills, like Beares, with
their Bowes in their mouthes, [and] charged us very desperately ...
After they had spent their Arrowes and felt the
sharpnesse of our shot, they retired into the Woods with a
great noise, and so left us.</p>

<p>The [28th] day ... we went further into the Bay, and saw
a plaine plot of ground where we went on Land ... we saw
nothing there but a Cannow, which was made out of the whole
tree, which was five and fortie foot long, by the Rule. Upon
this plot of ground we got good store of Mussels and Oysters,
which lay upon the ground as thicke as stones: wee opened
some and found in many of them Pearles. ... We passed
through excellent ground full of Flowers of divers kinds and
colours, and as goodly trees as I have seene, as cedar, cipresse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and other kindes. Going a little farther, we came into a little
plot full of fine and beautifull strawberries, foure times bigger
and better than ours in England.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>[The closing pages are in the main a list of deaths, through
August and September.] Our men were destroyed with cruell
diseases, as Swellings, Fluxes, Burning fevers, and by warres;
and some departed suddenly, but for the most part they died
of meere famine. There were never Englishmen left in a
forreigne Countrey in such miserie as wee were ... Wee
watched every three nights, lying on the bare cold ground,
what weather soever came; [and] warded all the next day,
which brought our men to bee most feeble wretches. Our feed
was but a small can of Barlie sod in Water to five men a day;
our drinke, cold water taken out of the River, which was at a
flood verie Salt, at a low tide full of slime and filth, which was
the destruction of many of our men. Thus we lived for the
space of five months in this miserable distresse, not having
five able men to man our Bulwarkes upon any occasion. If it
had not pleased God to have put a terrour in the Savages
heartes, we had all perished by those vild and cruell Pagans,
being in that weake estate ... our men night and day groaning
in every corner of the Fort most pittiful to heare. If there
were any conscience in men, it would make their harts to
bleede to heare the pittifull murmurings and outcries of our
sick men without reliefe every night and day for the space of
sixe weekes, some departing out of the World, many times
three or foure in a night, in the morning their bodies trailed
out of their Cabines like Dogges to be burried.</p>


<h5><i>b. "Gentlemen" in Virginia in 1608</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From an account written probably by Captain Todkill, a rough soldier,
and published in Smith's <i>Works</i> (Birmingham edition), 439.</p></div>

<p>But 30 of us he [Smith] conducted doune the river some 5
myles from James toune, to learne to make Clapbord, cut doune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
trees, and lye in the woods. Amongst the rest he had chosen
Gabriel Beadle, and John Russell, the onely two gallants of this
last Supply, and both proper Gentlemen. Straunge were these
pleasures to their conditions; yet lodging, eating, and drinking,
working or playing, they [were] but doing as the President
did himselfe. All these things were carried so pleasantly as
within a weeke they became Masters: making it their delight
to heare the trees thunder as they fell; but the Axes so oft
blistered their tender fingers that many times every third
blow had a loud othe to droune the eccho; for remedie of
which sinne, the President devised how to have every mans
othes numbred, and at night for every othe to have a Cann of
water poured doune his sleeve, with which every offender was
so washed (himselfe and all) that a man should scarce heare
an othe in a weeke.</p>

<p><i>By this, let no man thinke that the President and these Gentlemen
spent their times as common Wood haggers at felling of trees,
or such other like labour, or that they were pressed to it as hirelings,
or common slaves; for what they did, after they were but
once a little inured, it seemed ... onely as a pleasure and recreation:
yet 30 or 40 of such voluntary Gentleman would doe more
in a day than 100 of the rest that must be prest to it by compulsion;
but twentie good workemen had beene better than them all.</i></p>

suspected to affect the superstitions of the Church of <i>Rome</i>;
We do hereby <span class="smcap">DECLARE</span>, that it is our Will and Pleasure,

such Persons as shall at any time be sent and employed

<p>[It is a profitable exercise to read some of the sections in a more
logical order. Thus the political provisions are seen better if arranged
in the following sequence: XIV, XIII, XV, XXIII, XXIV, XXII.
Certainly, too, XXVIII should follow, or be combined with, XVI. The
utterly meaningless arrangement of many of these great documents, together
with the unpardonable carelessness of the copiers, account partly
for their needless length and largely for their obscurity.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Hints for Study.</b>&mdash;1. Compare the clauses relating to the oath of
supremacy in the second and third charters. (The passage given above
contains all such matter found in the third charter.) When the third
charter was issued, James had broken with his first parliament, and
probably wished to draw the great Catholic lords nearer to himself.</p>

<p>2. Compare the provisions for the meeting of the whole Company in
the second charter with the more specific provisions in the third.</p>

<p>3. The most important sections are VII and VIII. Observe that no regular
meetings of the Council are provided. That body had lost all controlling
power; it remained merely a preconsidering body, to prepare business
for the meetings of the stockholders. Five of the Council, however, had to
be of the small quorum necessary for one of the minor "courts" (VII), and,
in fact, those minor courts were <i>usually</i> little more than Council meetings.</p>

<p>From the general tenor of this charter and the preceding one, it would
seem as though "Planters" from Virginia, if present in London, might
attend the "Courts" and vote. But in practice, when this question
was raised, it was decided against the visiting Planters (<i>Company Records</i>,
II, 301). <i>Only holders of shares of stock could vote</i>, and, in practice,
stock certificates were not issued for emigration to America.</p></div>


<h4>22. Danger from Spanish Attack (1607-1614)</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The following extracts from the correspondence between Zu&ntilde;iga, the
Spanish ambassador at London, and the King of Spain are taken from
the documents printed in Brown's <i>Genesis</i>. These letters were usually
in cypher. The translations, of course, are in modern English. Cf.
<i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 24.</p></div>


<p><i>a. Zu&ntilde;iga to the King of Spain; London, October 16,
1607</i></p>

<p>Those who urge the colonization of Virginia become every
day more eager ... and before Nativity there will sail from
here [London] and from Plymouth five or six ships. <i>It will
be serving God and Your Majesty to drive these villains out from
there, hanging them.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[In this same letter, Zu&ntilde;iga says that he has found a man to inform
him of all the secret doings of the Council for Virginia; and, November 10,
he advises that the Spanish "Windward fleet" be used at once to drive
out the colonists. The Spanish Council at Madrid reported, however,
that the fleet was not in state of preparation.]</p></div>

<p>[December 6.] As to Virginia, I hear that three or four
other ships will return there. <i>Will your Majesty give orders
that measures be taken in time</i> [to destroy the settlement];
because now it will be very easy, and quite difficult afterwards,
when they have taken root; and if they are punished in the
beginning, the result will be that no more will go there.</p>

<p>[December 22.] It appears that there will be more people
there after Nativity than those I have written of. Wherefore
Your Majesty will see how necessary it is to act with vigor
<i>and hasten the remedy</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[After reading these letters, the Spanish Council made the following
record: "The Council says that having informed Your Majesty ...
Your Majesty was pleased to command that there should be prepared
whatever was necessary to drive out the people who are in Virginia."
This report is indorsed by the King: "Not to let anyone know what
is being done."</p>

<p>Similar matter is found in letters from Zu&ntilde;iga under date of March
28, 1608; November 8, 1608.]</p></div>

<p>[March 5, 1609.] The Baron de Arundel [an English
Catholic who had been a candidate for the governorship of
Virginia, and who now apparently was playing traitor] offers
to leave here whenever Your Majesty may command, under
pretext of a voyage of discovery, and that in the Canaries or
Porto Rico he will take on board the person Your Majesty
will send, as a man fleeing out of Spain, and will carry him
to Virginia, and instruct him as to ... the parts which the
English hold ... and that soon he will tell Your Majesty
by what means those people may be driven out without
violence.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> [But Zu&ntilde;iga urges immediate and violent action,
since King James is sure to acquiesce <i>after</i> the fact.] <i>Hence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>Your Majesty will command that they be destroyed with the utmost
possible promptness.</i></p>

<p>[April 12, 1609. After describing a new English expedition
to Virginia,&mdash;Lord Delaware's.] Your Majesty will see the
great importance of this matter for your Royal Service, and
thus, I hope, <i>will give orders to have these insolent people quickly
annihilated</i>.</p>


<p><i>b. Velasco (Zu&ntilde;iga's Successor at the English Court) to
the King of Spain; June 14, 1610</i></p>

<p>[After reporting the news of the terrible winter of 1609 in
Virginia] Thus it looks as if the zeal for this enterprise was
cooling off, <i>and it would be easy to make an end of it altogether by
sending out a few ships to finish what might be left in that place</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The Spanish Council report upon this letter to the King, and add:
"It appears to the Council that this should be communicated to the
Council of War ... and that it be asked to state what will be right and
proper to do, the supply of ships and whatever else may be needful for
that purpose. Y. M. will command what shall be done." This is indorsed,
with the King's signature, "<i>It is well</i>."]</p></div>


<p><i>c. Digby (English Ambassador at Madrid) to King
James</i></p>

<p>[September 22, 1612.] There is nothing so generally spoken
of in the Courte as their intent to remove Our plantation from
Virginia. And, for myne owne parte, I am of beliefe that the
Spaniards will serve us as thei did the Frenchmen in Florida
[Ribault's colony] unless wee undertake the business much
more thoroughly and roundely then hitherto wee have donne.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>[November 12, 1612.] I got a view of his [Zu&ntilde;iga's] dispatch
[by bribing some Spanish official, of course]. The chief
matters were ... that there was no cause to apprehend so
much danger in Virginia ... that he held it not unlikely <i>the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Business might sinke of itselfe</i>, since it was maynteyned but by
these shifts, which could last but for a yeare or two....</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[For some months after the above, however, Digby sends frequent
warnings of a Spanish expedition which he thinks is preparing against
Virginia (Brown, <i>Genesis</i>, 603, 609, 623); but May 13, 1613, he writes
again to James I:]</p></div>

<p>... theire resolution is not to stirre therein until they shall
be better informed ... they are yet in a greate hope that the
businesse will fall of itselfe. [Cf. other letters to the same
effect, May 22, May 26, Aug. 15, in Brown's <i>Genesis</i>, 634, 635,
656.]</p>

some ten pages. It includes 21 of the greatest lords in England, 96 knights

"sadlers," "drapers," "grocers," etc., with some professional men and
others not classified. Fifty of the incorporators were members of the existing

Among the 659 incorporators were Robert Cecil (the minister of

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> England in the seventeenth century still used the "Old Style" dates,

of January 1, and all dates between these two (from January 1 to March 25)
were then given in the year previous to the one in which our "New Style"
puts them. Moreover, the New Style moved all dates forward ten days.
Therefore <i>March 12, 1611</i>, as the charter was dated at the time, means to us

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Peter Force's <i>Historical Tracts</i>, III (Washington, 1844), No. 6.</p>

<p>These rules, one hundred thirty-two in number, and bulky enough to
fill fifty pages of this volume, were adopted by the London Company
shortly after it came under Liberal control, in June, 1619. For the
history of the struggle in the Company, cf. a brief statement in <i>American
History and Government</i>, &sect; 27.</p></div>

<p>XV.&mdash;At the great and generall Court, commonly called the
Quarter Court, in Easter Terme, all offices of this Company
(excepting the Counseil) shall be void: And the Court shall
proceede to an election of new Officers, in manner following.</p>

<p>XVII.&mdash;After the choise of a Treasuror, a Deputie shall be
chosen; then the Auditors, and Comitties; and lastly the
Secretarie, Bookekeeper, Husband, and Bedle.</p>

<p>XVIII.&mdash;At the choise of each Officer, the persons nominated
for the election, shall withdraw themselves till the party
chosen be publiquely so pronounced. And generally no man
shall be present in the Court whilst himselfe or his matter
passeth the judgement of the Court.</p>

<p>XX.&mdash;It is for weighty reasons thought very expedient,
that no man continue in the place of Treasurer or Deputie,
above three yeares at once.</p>

<p>XXI.&mdash;For the avoiding of divers inconveniences, It is
thought fit that all elections of principall Officers in or for<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Virginia as also of the Treasurer and Deputie here, be performed
by a <i>Ballating box, as in some other Companies</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>XXVI.&mdash;He [the Treasurer] is to propound and put all
things to the question which the Court requires, under paine
of being immediately put from his Office, if he refuse. In
which case the Deputie shall doo it, under the like paine. And
if he refuse, then any of the Council there present.</p>

<p>LXXXIX.&mdash;Every man speaking in Court, shall addresse
his speech to the Treasuror, or deputie in his absence, as
representing the Court: And all private speeches, or directed
to particular persons, shall be forborne.</p>

<p>XCI.&mdash;No man with his speech shall interrupt the speech
of another, before he have finished: Except the Treasurer, or
in his absence the Deputie, (with approbation of the Court) see
cause to put any to silence, for impertinency, or other unseemely
speaking.</p>

<p>XCIV.&mdash;Whosoever shall attempt by private solicitation to
packe the Court to any unjust or unlawfull end, shall, upon
complaint, be convented before the Counseil, and, being convicted,
shall be disfranchized.</p>

Governour, Lieutenant Governour, Admirall, Marshal, chiefe
Justice, and Treasuror, shall be chosen here <i>by Ballating</i> in
a Quarter-Court.</p>

<p>CII.&mdash;The Counseil established in Virginia, and all other
Officers there reserved to the choise of the Companie here,
shall be chosen in a Quarter-Court by onely erection of hands;
<i>unlesse the Court desire to have it passe by Ballating</i>.</p>

<p>[The frequent reference to the ballot in these rules is a sufficient answer
to an absurd claim that the English colonies had to learn that device
from Holland. Cf. <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 77. The use of

of elections under these rules, as in <i>Records</i>, I, 315, 368, 385, 440, 468,

<h4>24. An Order of the London Company as to Self-government
February 2/12, 1619/20</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Records of the Virginia Company in London</i> (edited by Susan Kingsbury;
Washington, 1906), I, 303.</p>

<p>This order, to provide for temporary self-government in new colonies
under the jurisdiction of the Company, was adopted on the same day that
the Company made four grants of land to companies expecting to settle
in "Virginia." One of these grants was to John Pierce and his Associates.
Pierce was one of the London partners of the Mayflower Pilgrims.
The order below <i>may</i> therefore have suggested to the Pilgrims the Mayflower
Compact (No. 52 below).</p></div>

<p>It was ordered by generall Consent that such Captaines or
Leaders of Perticulerr Plantacions that shall goe there to
inhabite ... in Virginia, shall have liberty, till a forme of
Goverment bee here settled for them, Associatinge unto them
divers of the gravest and discreetes of their companies, to
make Orders, Ordinances, and Constitucions for the better
orderinge and dyrectinge of their Servants and buisines, Provided
they be not Repugnant to the Lawes of England.</p>


<h4>25. The First Representative Assembly in America
July 30/August 9, 1619</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Stith and Hening (Nos. 16, 17), those early and zealous explorers in
Virginian records, both believed that no record of this great Assembly
was extant. George Bancroft, however, found a copy in the London
Record Office, in 1856, and published it in the <i>New York Historical Society
Collections</i> of 1857. A somewhat more critical text was published in
1874 by Wynne and Gilman, in their thin volume of <i>Colonial Records of
Virginia</i>. The record was made by John Twine, Clerk of the Assembly.
It is printed here almost in full.</p></div>

<p>The most convenient place we could finde to sitt in was the
Quire of the Churche Where Sir George Yeardley, the Governour,
being sett down in his accustomed place, those of the
Counsel of Estate sate nexte him on both handes, excepte onely
the Secretary then appointed Speaker, who sate right before
him, John Twine, clerke of the General assembly, being placed
nexte the Speaker, and Thomas Pierse, the Sergeant, standing
at the barre, to be ready for any Service the Assembly should
comaund him. But forasmuche as men's affaires doe little
prosper where God's service is neglected, all the Burgesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
tooke their places in the Quire till a prayer was said by Mr.
Bucke, the Minister, that it would please God to guide and
sanctifie all our proceedings to his owne glory and the good of
this Plantation. Prayer being ended, to the intente that as
we had begun at God Almighty, so we might proceed with
awful and due respecte towards the Lieutenant, our most gratious
and dread Soveraigne, all the Burgesses were intreatted
to retyre themselves into the body of the Churche, which being
done, before they were fully admitted, they were called in order
and by name, and so every man (none staggering at it) tooke
the oathe of Supremacy, and then entred the Assembly....</p>

<p>These obstacles removed, the Speaker, who a long time had
bene extreame sickly and therefore not able to passe through
long harrangues, delivered in briefe to the whole assembly the
occasions of their meeting. Which done, he read unto them
the commission for establishing the Counsell of Estate and
the general Assembly, wherein their duties were described to
the life.</p>

<p>Having thus prepared them, he read over unto them the
greate Charter, or commission of priviledges, orders and lawes,
sent by Sir George Yeardly out of Englande. Which for the
more ease of the Committies, having divided into fower books,
he read the former two the same forenoon, for expeditious sake,
a second time over, and so they were referred to the persuall of
twoe Comitties, which did reciprocally consider of either, and
accordingly brought in their opinions. But some men may
here objecte to what ende we should presume to referre that
to the examination of the Comitties which the Counsell and
Company in England had already resolved to be perfect, and
did expecte nothing but our assente thereunto? To this we
answere that we did it not to the ende to correcte or controll anything
therein contained, but onely in case we should finde ought
not perfectly squaring with the state of this Colony, or any lawe
which did presse or binde too harde, that we might, by waye of
humble petition, seeke to have it redressed, <i>especially because
this great Charter is to binde us and our heyers for ever</i>....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>After dinner the Governor and those that were not of the
Comitties sate a seconde time, while the said Comitties were
employed in the perusall of those twoe bookes. And whereas
the Speaker had propounded fower severall objects for the
Assembly to consider on: namely, first, the great charter of
orders, lawes, and priviledges; Secondly, which of the instructions
given by the Counsel in England to my [Lord De La
Warre], Captain Argall, or Sir George Yeardley, might conveniently
putt on the habite of lawes; Thirdly, what lawes might
issue out of the private conceipte of any of the Burgesses,
or any other of the Colony; and lastly, what petitions were fitt
to be sente home for England. It pleased the Governour for
expedition sake to have the second objecte of the fower to be
examined and prepared by himselfe and the Non-Comitties.
Wherin after having spente some three howers conference, the
twoe Committies brought in their opinions concerning the twoe
former bookes, (the second of which beginneth at these words

<p>Here begin the lawes drawen out of the Instructions
given by his Majesties Counsell
of Virginia in England to my lo: la

<p>By this present Generall Assembly be it enacted, that no
injury or oppression be wrought by the Englishe against the
Indians whereby the present peace might be disturbed and
antient quarrells might be revived....</p>

<p>Against Idleness, Gaming, durunkenes, and excesse in apparell,
the Assembly hath enacted as followeth:</p>

<p>First, in detestation of Idlenes be it enacted, that if any
men be founde to live as an Idler or renagate, though a freedman,
it shalbe lawfull for that Incorporation or Plantation to
which he belongeth to appoint him a Mr [Master] to serve for
wages, till he shewe apparant signes of amendment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Against gaming at dice and Cardes be it ordained by this
present assembly that the winner or winners shall lose all his
or their winninges and both winners and loosers shall forfaicte
ten shillings a man, one ten shillings whereof to go to the discoverer,
and the rest to charitable and pious uses in the Incorporation
where the faulte is comitted.</p>

<p>Against drunkenness be it also decreed that if any private
person be found culpable thereof, for the first time he is to be
reprooved privately by the Minister, the second time publiquely,
the thirde time <i>to lye in boltes 12 howers</i> in the house of the
Provost Marshall and to paye his fee, and if he still continue
in that vice, to undergo suche severe punishment as the
Governor and Counsell of Estate shall thinke fitt to be inflicted
on him. [Provision for milder penalty for drunken officials.]</p>

<p><i>Against excesse in apparell</i>, that every man be cessed in the
churche for all publique contributions, if he be unmarried
according to his owne apparrell, if he be married according to
his owne and his wives, or either of their apparrell....</p>

<p>Be it enacted by this present assembly that for laying a
surer foundation of the conversion of the Indians to Christian
Religion, eache towne, citty, Borrough, and particular plantation
do obtaine unto themselves by just means a certaine
number of the natives' children to be educated by them in the
true religion and civile course of life&mdash;of which children the
most towardly boyes in witt and graces of nature to be brought
up by them in the first elements of litterature, so to be fitted
for the Colledge intended for them, that from thence they may
be sente to that worke of conversion.</p>

<p>As touching the business of planting corne this present
Assembly doth ordaine that yeare by yeare all and every
householder and householders have in store for every servant
he or they shall keep, and also for his or their owne persons,
whether they have any Servants or no, one spare barrell of
corne, to be delivered out yearly, either upon sale or exchange
as need shall require. For the neglecte of which duty he
shalbe subjecte to the censure of the Governor and Counsell of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>

man this lawe shall not be of force.</p>

<p>About the Plantation of Mulberry trees, be it enacted that
every man as he is seatted upon his division, doe for seven years
together every yeare plante and maintaine in growte six Mulberry
trees at the least, and as many more as he shall thinke conveniente
and as his virtue and Industry shall move him to plante,
and that all suche persons as shall neglecte the yearly planting
and maintaining of that small proportion shalbe subjecte to the
censure of the Governour and the Counsell of Estate.</p>

<p>Be it farther enacted as concerning Silke-flaxe, that those
men that are upon their division or setled habitation doe this
next yeare plante and dresse 100 plantes, which being founde a
comedity, may farther be increased. And whosoever do faill
in the performance of this shalbe subject to the punishment
of the Governour and Counsell of Estate.</p>

<p>For hempe also both Englishe and Indian, and for Englishe
flax and Anniseeds, we do require and enjoine all householders
of this Colony that have any of those seeds to make tryal
thereofe the nexte season.</p>

<p>Moreover be it enacted by this present Assembly, that every
householder do yearly plante and maintaine ten vines untill
they have attained to the art and experience of dressing a
Vineyard either by their owne industry or by the Instruction
of some Vigneron ... upon what penalty soever the Governor
and Counsell of Estate shall thinke fitt to impose upon
the neglecters of this acte.</p>

<p>Be it also enacted that all necessary tradesmen, or so many
as need shall require, suche as are come over since the departure
of Sir Thomas Dale, or that shall hereafter come, shall
worke at their trades for any other man, each one being
payde according to the quality of his trade and worke, to be
estimated, if he shall not be contented, by the Governor and
officers of the place where he worketh.</p>

between the owners of lande and their Tenants and Servantes
which they shall sende hither, may be caused to be
duely performed, and that the offenders be punished as the
Governour and Counsell of Estate shall thinke just and convenient.</p>

<p>Be it established also by this present Assembly that no
crafty or advantagious means be suffered to putt in practise
for the inticing awaye the Tenants or Servants of any particular
plantation from the place where they are seatted. And
that it shalbe the duty of the Governor and Counsell of Estate
most severely to punishe both the seducers and the seduced,
and to returne these latter into their former places....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, Aug. 3, 1619.&mdash; ... Captaine William Powell
presented a Petition to the generall Assembly against one
Thomas Garnett, a servant of his, not onely for extreame neglect
of his business to the great loss and prejudice of the said
Captaine, and for openly and impudently abusing his house, ...
but also for falsely accusing him to the Governor both of
Drunkenes and Thefte, and besides for bringing all his fellow
servants to testify on his side, wherein they justly failled him.
It was thought fitt by the general assembly (the Governour
himselfe giving sentence), that he should stand fower dayes
with his eares nayled to the Pillory, viz: Wednesday, Aug 4th,
and so likewise Thursday, fryday and Satturday next following,
and every of those fower dayes should be publiquely whipped.
Now, as touching the neglecte of his worke, what satisfaction
ought to be made to his Mr. for that is referred to the Governor
and Counsell of Estate.</p>

<p>The same morning the lawes abovewritten, drawen out of the
instructions, were read, and one by one thoroughly examined,
and then passed once again....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span> Aug. 4th.&mdash;This daye (by reason of extream
heat, both paste and likely to ensue, and by that meanes of the

the Governour, who himselfe also was not well, resolved should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
be the last of this first session; so in the morning the
Speaker (as he was required by the Assembly) redd over all
the lawes and orders that had formerly passed the house, to
give the same yett one reviewe more, and to see whether there
were any thing to be amended or that might be excepted againste.
This being done, the third sorte of lawes which I am nowe coming
to sett downe, were read over [and] thoroughly discussed, which
together with the former, did now passe the last and finall consente
of the General Assembly.</p>

<p class="center">A third sorte of lawes, suche as may issue out of
                    every man's private conceipte.</p>

<p>... All Ministers in the Colony shall once a year, namely,
in the moneth of Marche, bring to the Secretary of Estate a
true account of all Christenings, burials and marriages, upon
paine, if they faill, to be censured for their negligence by the
Governor and Counsell....</p>

<p>No man, without leave of the Governor, shall kill any Neatt
Cattle whatsoever, young or olde, especially kine ... upon
penalty of forfeiting the value of the beast so killed.</p>

<p>Whosoever shall take any of his neighbors' boates, oares, or
canvas, without leave from the owner, shall be held and esteemed
as a felon, and so proceeded against.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>All ministers shall duly read divine service, and exercise
their ministerial function according to the Ecclesiastical lawes
and orders of the churche of Englande, and every Sunday in
the afternoon shall Catechize suche as are not yet ripe to come
to the Com. And whosoever of them shalbe found negligent
or faulty in this kinde shalbe subject to the censure of the
Governor and Counsell of Estate....</p>

<p>For reformation of swearing, every freeman and Master of a
family, after thrice admonition [by church wardens], shall give
5 s ... to the use of the church ... and every servant ...
except his Mr discharge the fine, shalbe subject to whipping.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>Provided that, the payment of the fine notwithstanding, the
said servant shall acknowledge his faulte publiquely in the
Churche.</p>

<p>All persons whatsoever upon the Sabaoth daye shall frequente
divine service and sermons both forenoon and afternoon, and
all suche as beare arms shall bring their pieces, swordes, poulder
and shotte. And every one that shall trangresse this lawe shall
forfaicte three shillinges a time to the use of the churche, all
lawful and necessary impediments excepted. But if a servant
in this case shall wilfully neglecte his Mr's commande he shall
suffer bodily punishmente.</p>

<p>No maide or woman servant, either now resident in the Colonie
or hereafter to come, shall contract herselfe in marriage
without either the consente of her parents, or of her Master or
Mistress, or of the magistrat and minister of the place both
together. And whatsoever minister shall marry or contracte
any suche persons without some of the foresaid consentes shalbe
subjecte to the severe censure of the Governor and Counsell of
Estate.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Here ende the lawes.</i></p>

<p>... Captain Henry Spellman was called to the barre
to answere to certaine misdemeanors ... whereupon the
General Assembly, having thoroughly heard and considered
his speeches [evidence had been taken and defense put in],
did constitute the following order [For exposing the colony to
disturbance from the Indians by inciting them to disrespect
of the government, Spellman was "degraded of his title of
Captaine" and "condemned to performe seven yeares service to
the Colony" as an interpreter to the governor.]</p>

<p>[Provision that every male in the colony over 16 years of
age shall be taxed "one pound of the best tobacco" for pay to
the officers of the Assembly.]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thirdly, the General Assembly doth humbly beseech the ...
Treasurer, Counsell and Company that, albeit it belongeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
to them onely to allowe or to abrogate any lawes which we shall
here make ... yet that it would please them not to take it in
ill parte if these lawes ... do passe currant and be of force till
suche time as we may knowe their farther pleasure....</p>

<p>Their last humble suite is that the said Counsell and Company
would be pleased, so soon as they shall find it convenient, to
make good their <i>promise sett downe at the conclusion of their
commission for establishing the Counsel of Estate and the General
Assembly, namely that they give us power to allowe or to disallowe
of their orders of Courts, as his Majesty hath given them power

<p>In sume, Sir George Yeardley, the Governor, prorogued the
said general Assembly till the firste of Marche, which is to
fall out this present yeare of 1619 [1620. New Style; cf. note,
page 44], and in the mean season dissolved the same.</p>


<h4>26. The London Company's "Declaration," June, 1620</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Peter Force's <i>Historical Tracts</i> (Washington, 1844), III, No. 5.</p>

<p>Sandys resigned his "Treasurership" at the Court of the Company
in May, 1620. The statistics of his report, with an enthusiastic general
statement to introduce them, were published soon afterward by the
Company as "A Declaration of the State of the Colonie and Affaires in
Virginia." Sandys' report is now printed in full in the <i>Records</i> of the
Company, edited by Susan Kingsbury (Washington, 1906).</p></div>

<p>After the many disasters wherewith it pleased Almighty
God to suffer the great Enemy of all good Actions to encounter
and interrupt this noble Action for the planting of
Virginia with the Christian Religion and English people,
it having pleased him now, contrarily, of his especiall great
grace, so to blesse and prosper our late carefull endeavors ...
that [the colony] hath as it were growne to double that height,
strength, plenty, and prosperity which it had in former
times. ... We have thought it now the peculiar duety of
our place ... to Summon, as it were, by a kinde of loving
invitement, the whole body of the Noble and other worthy
Adventurors, as well to the ... perfecting of this happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
worke as to the reaping of the fruit of their great expenses
and travailes.</p>

<p>... [And first, to remove the effect of slanders upon Virginia,
the Company declares] the Countrey is rich, spacious, and well
watered; temperate as for the Climate; very healthfull after
men are a little accustomed to it; abounding with all Gods
naturall blessings: The Land replenished with the goodliest
Woods in the world, and those full of <i>Deere</i>, and other Beasts
of sustenance: The Seas and Rivers (whereof many are exceeding
faire and navigable) full of excellent Fish, and of
all sorts desireable; both Water and Land yeelding Fowle in
very great store and variety: In Summe, a Countrey too good
for ill people; and wee hope reserved by the providence of God
for such as shall apply themselves faithfully to his service
and be a strength and honour to our King and Nation....</p>

<p>The rich Furres, Caviary, and Cordage, which we draw
from <i>Russia</i> with so great difficulty, are to be had in <i>Virginia</i>,
and the parts adjoining, with ease and plenty. The Masts,
Planckes, and Boords, the Pitch and Tarre, the Pot-ashes and
Sope-ashes, the Hempe and Flax (being the materials of
Linnen) which now we fetch from <i>Norway</i>, <i>Denmarke</i>, <i>Poland</i>,
and <i>Germany</i>, are there to be had in abundance and great
perfection. The <i>Iron</i>, which hath so wasted our <i>English</i>
Woods,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> that it selfe in short time must decay together with
them, is to be had in <i>Virginia</i> (where wasting of Woods is a
benefit) for all good conditions answerable to the best in the
world. The Wines, Fruite, and Salt of <i>France</i> and <i>Spaine</i>,
The Silkes of <i>Persia</i> and <i>Italie</i>, will be found also in <i>Virginia</i>,
and in no kinde of worth inferior. Wee omit here a multitude
of other naturall Commodities, dispersed up and downe the
divers parts of the world: of Woods, Rootes, and Berries, for
excellent Dyes: Of Plants and other Drugges, for Physicall
service: Of sweet Woods, Oyles, and Gummes, for pleasure
and other use: Of Cotton-wooll, and Sugar-Canes: all which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
may there also be had in abundance, with an infinity of other
more: And will conclude with these three, Corne, Cattle, and
Fish, which are the substance of the foode of man. The
Graines of our Countrey doe prosper there very well: Of
Wheate they have great plenty: But their <i>Maze</i>, being the
naturall Graine of that Countrey, doth farre exceede in pleasantnesse,
strength, and fertility. The Cattle which we have
transported thither (being now growne neere to five hundred)
become much bigger of Body then the breed from which they
came: The Horses also more beautifull, and fuller of courage.
And such is the extraordinary fertility of that <i>Soyle</i>, that the
<i>Does</i> of their <i>Deere</i> yeelde two Fawnes at a birth, and sometimes
three. The Fishings at <i>Cape Codd</i>, being within those
Limits, will in plenty of Fish be equall to those of <i>Newfound
Land</i>, and in goodnesse and greatnesse much superiour. To
conclude, it is a Countrey, which nothing but ignorance can
thinke ill of, and which no man but of a corrupt minde and
ill purpose can defame.</p>

<p>Now touching the present estate of our Colony in that Country,
Wee have thought it not unfit thus much briefly to declare.
There have beene sent thither this last yeare, and are
now presently in going, twelve hundred persons and upward,
as particularly appeareth in the note above [below] specified:
and there are neere one thousand more remaining of those
that were gone before. <i>The men lately sent, have beene most
of them choise men, borne and bred up to labour and industry.
Out of Devonshire, about an hundred men, brought up to Husbandry.
Out of Warickshire and Staffordshire, above one hundred
and ten; and out of Sussex about forty; all framed to
Iron-workes: the rest dispersedly out of divers Shires of the
Realme. There have been also sundry persons of good quality,
much commended for sufficiency, industry and honesty, provided
and sent to take charge and government of those people.</i> The
care likewise that hath beene taken by directions, Instructions,
Charters, and Commissions to reduce the people and affaires
in <i>Virginia</i> into a regular course, hath beene such and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
great that the Colony beginneth now to have the face and
fashion of an orderly State, and such as is likely to grow and
prosper. The people are all divided into severall Burroughs;
each man having the shares of Land due to him set out, to
hold and enjoy to him and his Heires. The publique Lands
for the Company here, for the Governor there, for the College,
and for each particular Burrough, for the Ministers also, and
for divers other necessary Officers, are likewise laid out by
order, and bounded. The particular Plantations for divers
private Societies, are settled in their Seates, being allotted
to their content, and each in convenient distance. <i>The rigour
of Martiall Law, wherewith before they were governed, is reduced
within the limits prescribed by his Majesty; and the laudable
forme of Justice and government used in this Realme</i> [<i>is</i>] <i>established
and followed as neere as may be. The governour is
so restrained to a Counseil joyned with him that hee can doe no
wrong to no man who may not have speedy remedy. ...</i></p>

<p>In summe, they [the colonists] are now so full of alacritie and
cheerefulnesse, that, in a late generall Assembly, they have, in
the name of the Colony, presented their greatest possible
thankes to the Company....</p>

<p>[After enumerating recent grants]</p>

<p>These and other like Planters, having priority of time, will
have priority also in choise of the Seat of their Plantations.
Seeing therefore the onely matter of retribution to the Adventurors,
is by a faire proportion of Land to them and their heires;
namely of one hundred acres for every share of twelve pounds
and ten shillings, upon a first division; and as much more upon
a second, the first being peopled; with fiftie acres for every person
(to be doubled in like manner) which at their owne charges
they shall transport to inhabit in <i>Virginia</i> before the 24th day
of <i>June 1625</i> [therefore, quite after the fashion of modern land
companies, intending "adventurers" are urged to invest
promptly, before the choice land is all taken].</p>

<h4>27. The Ordinance of 1621 for Virginia</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Stith's <i>History of Virginia</i>, App. IV; Hening's <i>Statutes</i>, I, 110 ff.</p>

<p>The <i>Records</i> of the Virginia Assembly of 1619 (see No. 25 above) show
that the London Company had given to the settlers a "great charter." No
copy of it exists; but apparently its political features were repeated in
this document, issued by the Company July 24/Aug. 3, 1621, on the appointment
of a new governor. This great Ordinance has sometimes been
called, mistakenly, The First Charter to the Virginian Colonists. It is
the <i>second</i> such charter. Cf. <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 30.</p></div>

<p><i>An Ordinance and Constitution of the Treasurer, Council, and
Company in</i> England, <i>for a Council of State and General Assembly.</i></p>

<p>I.&mdash;To all People, to whom these Presents shall come, be
seen, or heard, The Treasurer, Council, and Company of Adventurers
and Planters for the city of <i>London</i> for the first
Colony of <i>Virginia</i> send Greeting. <span class="smcap">Know ye</span>, that we, the
said Treasurer, Council, and Company, taking into our Consideration
the present State of the said Colony of Virginia, and
intending, by the Divine Assistance, to settle such a Form of
Government there, as may be to the greatest Benefit and Comfort
of the People, and whereby all Injustice, Grievances, and
Oppression may be prevented and kept off as much as possible
from the said Colony, have thought fit to make our Entrance,
by ordering and establishing such Supreme Councils as may
not only be assisting to the Governor for the time being, in the
Administration of Justice, and the Executing of other Duties
to this Office belonging, but also, by their vigilant Care and
and Prudence, may provide as well for a Remedy of all Inconveniences,
growing from time to time, as also for the advancing
of Increase, Strength, Stability, and Prosperity of the
said Colony:</p>

by Us, the said Treasurer, Council, and Company, and our Successors:
Which Council of State shall consist, for the present,
only of these persons, as are here inserted, <i>viz.</i> Sir <i>Francis

Name strictly charge and command, that (all Factions, Partialities,
and sinister Respect laid aside) they bend their Care and
Endeavours to assist the said Governor; first and principally, in
the Advancement of the Honour and Service of God, and the
Enlargement of his Kingdom amongst the Heathen People;
and next, in erecting of the said Colony in due Obedience to
his Majesty, and all lawful Authority from his Majesty's Directions;
and lastly, in maintaining the said People in Justice
and <i>Christian</i> Conversation amongst themselves, and in Strength

<h4>28. Royal Attempts to Control the Company, 1620-1622</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Records of the Virginia Company</i>, I and II, under dates given. These
Records were first published in full in 1908 by the Government Printing
Office at Washington. For a brief outline of the history, with references
to some other source material, cf. <i>American History and Government</i>,
&sect; 32.</p></div>

<p>(1) <i>A Quarter Courte held for Virginia at Mr Ferrars in St
Sithes Lane the 17th of May 1620.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Present</i>&mdash;[The list includes 172 names with the addenda "and many
others." The first eight named were Lords; the next thirty, knights.]</p></div>

<p>Uppon request of some of the generallytie itt was ordered
that frome hence forth before the Company proceed to the
choyce of their Officers the Chapter or title of election [<i>i.e.</i>,
the company's rules regarding elections] shall allwaies be red
before.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Imeadiately after, and before they proceeded in any buisines,
one mr Kerkham agent, sent from the King, presented himselfe
to the boord and signified to the Courte that his Majestie,
understandinge of the Eleccion of their Treasuror, which
they intended this day to make choyce of, out of an especiall
care and respect hee hath to that Plantacion, hath required
him to nominate unto them ffower, outt of which his pleasure
is the Company should make choyce of one to be their Treasurer;
That was, Sir Thomas Smith, Sir Thomas Roe, Mr.
Alderman Johnson, and Mr. Maurice Abbott, <i>and noe other</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These buisines beinge thus ordered mr Treasurer accordinge
to the standing Lawes of the Company before the giveinge
upp of his place proceeded to declare unto this Courte
the State of the Colony together with the Supplies of this
yeare, and the present State of the Treasury, how both hee
found itt and now should leave itt. [See No. 26 above.]</p>

<p>Lastly hee concluded with his respective thanks, first to the
Company in generall for their love in chosinge him, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
particularly to the Lords for their so frequent presence to
the graceinge of the Courte and great assistance in the buisines;
to the Officers for their faythfull joyninge with him
in the supportinge of his burthen; and againe to the Courte
in generall for their patience in bearringe with his unwillinge
errors and other naturall infirmities. So deliveringe upp
his Office togeather with the Sealls, hee desyred the Courte
to proceed in Eleccion of their Treasuror, accordinge to the
message lately receaved from his Majesty: and theruppon
withdrew himselfe out of the Courte.</p>

<p>Uppon which this great and generall Courte found themselves
uppon a deliberate consideracion of the matter att an
exceedinge pinch: for if they should not doe as the Kinge
had commaunded they might incurre suspicion of defect in
poynte of duety,&mdash;from which they protested they were and
would be free; on the other side, if they should proceed accordinge
to the lymitts of that message they suffered a greate
breach into their Prevyledge of free Eleccion graunted to
them by his Majestys letters Pattents, which they held fitt
rather to lay downe with all dutie and submission att his
Majesties ffeet then to be depryved of their pryveledge. And
theruppon perusing the said letters Pattents, after longe
arguinge and debatinge, itt was concluded by generall ereccion
of hands, that the eleccion might and should be adjourned
to the next Quarter Courte notwithstanding any order
made by the Company to the contrarie.</p>

<p>Wheruppon forasmuch as itt manyfestly appeared that his
Majestie hadd beene much misinformed of the menaginge
of their buisines this last yeare, Itt was agreed accordinge
to the opynion aforesaide that the day of Eleccon should be
putt of till the next generall Courte some six weeks hence
in Midsomer Tearme, and till they understood the Kings
farther pleasure, And in the intrym they humbly entreated
the Right Honorable the Lord of Southampton, Vyscount
Doncaster, The Lord Cavendish, the Lord Sheffield, Sir John
Davers, Sir Nicholas Tufton, Sir Lawrence Hide, mr Chris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>topher
Brook, mr Gibbes, mr Herbert, mr Keightley, and mr
Cranmer to meet uppon ffryday morninge att Southampton
house to determine of an humble answere unto his Majesties
message and to deliver to him a true informaccon as well of
the former as of this latter years government of the buisines
for Virginia, beseechinge allso that his Majestie would be
pleased not to take from them the Pryveledge of their letters
Pattents, butt that itt might be in their owne choyce to have
free eleccion.</p>

<p>Uppon which, till his Majesties pleasure were knowne, Sir
Edwin Sandys, after much and ernest refusall, att length
uppon ernest request of the whole Courte hee yeilded to sett
down in his former place, yett forbearinge to receave the
Seales againe or to putt any thinge to Question; and all other
Officers were likewise continued till the same time.</p>

<p><i>(2) A Great and Generall Quarter Courte helde in the afternoone
at Mr. Ferrars House. 28th July 1620.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Earle of Southampton acquainted this Courte that himselfe
with the rest of the Lords and gentlemen requested therunto
by the last Quarter Courte had presented their humble
desires unto his Majestie for the free eleceon of their Treasurer,
wherunto his Majestie had most gratiously condiscented, signyfyinge
unto them that it would be pleasinge to him they
made choyce of such a one as might att all times and occasions
have free accesse unto his royall personn. And further declaringe
that itt was the mistakinge of the messenger, haveinge not
receaved his message imeadiately from his owne royall mouth,
to exclud them from the libertie of choosinge any butt the
fower nominated, whom his Majesties intent was indeed to recommend
butt not so as to barr the Company from the choyse
of any other.</p>

<p>Wheruppon the wholl Courte rendred to his Majestie all
humble thanks and ordered that by writinge itt should be signified
unto his Majestie:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Then mr Herbert delivered unto the Company that wheras
by some distractions and discentions in the Company the buisines
much suffered in the reputaccon and otherwise, they should
now think uppon some Person of such worth and authoritie as
might give full remedie therunto, which since itt could not be
performed by the late Treasurer a man of that greate habilitie
and sufficiencie together with his industrie and integritie as of
his ranke ther could not be found any to passe him, there was
now lefte noe hope except itt might please some of those Honorable
personages [Lords] then present to vouchsaffe to accept
of the place, who by adiccon of Nobilitie might effect that
which others by meere habillytie could not doe.</p>

<p>Which moccon beinge exceedinglie approved, the whole
Courte imeadiately with much joy and applause nominated the
Earle of Southampton, with much ernestnes beseechinge his
Lordship that for the redeeminge of this Noble Plantaccon and
Company from the ruines that seemed to hange over itt hee
would vouchsaffe to accept of the place of Treasurer.</p>

<p>Which itt pleased him after some finale pause in fine to doe
in very noble manner out of the worthie love and affeccon that
hee bare to the Plantaccon. And the Courte in testimoniall of
their bounden thankfullnes and of the great honoure and respect
they ought him, did resolve <i>to surcease the ballatinge box</i>;
and without nominaccon of any other, by ereccon of hands, his
Lordship was chosen Treasurer and tooke his Oath. Which
done, his Lordship desyred the Company that they would all
putt on the same myndes with which hee hadd accepted that
place.</p>

<p><i>(3) At a great and generall Quarter Courte held for Virginia in
the Afternoone the 22 of May 1622.</i></p>

<p>Imediately after these things were thus ordered, as the Court
were proceedinge after their accustomed manner to the eleccon
of their Treasurer Deputy and other Officers for this present
yeare accordinge to the direccon of his Majesties Letters
Patents, mr Alderman Hamersly rose upp and havinge first ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>cused
his seldome comminge to Courts by reason of the Officers
negligent warninge of him, he said That himselfe and mr Bell
were both commaunded by mr Secretary Calvert to deliver a
Message in his Majesties name unto this Court, namely to signifie,
that although it was not his Majesties desire to infringe
their liberty of free elleccon yet it would be pleasing unto him,
if they made choise for Treasuror and Deputy any of those
gentlemen (commended for their Sufficiency), whose names
were mencioned in the paper nowe presented in open Court
which were these that followe vizt. [The names of five gentlemen
nominated by the King for Treasurer, and five more for
Deputy.]...</p>

<p>Mr Bell, beinge also entreated to deliver the Message he had
receaved from mr Secretary Calvert, said that he was not present
when mr Secretary Calvert imparted this Message to mr
Alderman Hamersley, but that there came a Messenger to him
over night to require him to attend mr Secretary Calvert at
his Chamber; and beinge there, mr Secretary told him that his
Majestie commaunded him to signifie his pleasure that out of
his good wishes (for the good of the Company and the Plantation)
he had recommended to this Court certaine Gentlemen
(named in the paper nowe presented) if the Company so
thought good: But it was not his meaning to infringe the liberty
of their free choise; And beinge desirous to have had his
Message in writinge, mr Secretary said it needed not for it was
but short.</p>

<p>Both which Messages agreeing in substance, and beinge a
full remonstrance of his Majesties well wishing unto the Plantation
and of his graceous meaninge not to infringe the priviledge of
the Companie and liberty of their free eleccon, was receaved with
great love and contentment of the whole Court; and therupon
proceedinge to the eleccon of their Treasuror (for which onely
three by the orders of the Company could stand). It was generally
agreed that out of the five formerly proposed by his
Majestie for Treasuror, choise should be made of two of them
to stand in eleccon with one that the Companie should name:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Wherupon the former five beinge severally put to the question,
it appeared by ereccon of most hands that mr Clethero and mr
Hanford were to stand for it: Then the Companie named the
Lord of Southampton; who beinge all three accordingly ballated,
the place fell to the Lord of Southampton by havinge 117 balls,
mr Clethero 13 and mr Hanford 7. In like manner out of the
five formerly named by his Majestie for Deputy, by ereccion of
most hands, mr Leat and mr Bateman were to stand for it; unto
whome the Companie havinge added mr Nicholas ffarrer, they
were all three put to the Ballatinge Boxe, and thereupon choise
was made of mr Nicholas ffarar by havinge 103, mr Bateman
10: and mr Leate 5.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Itt beinge moved that there might be some presentaccon of
the Companies humble thankfullnes unto his Majestie in respect
of the graceous Message formerly delivered, after some
deliberaccon had thereuppon, the Court conceaved it fitt to be
sett downe in these words (vizt) That the Lord Cavendish the
Lord Padgett, the Lord Haughton are humbly requested by
the Court to present their most humble thanks to his Majestie
for his graceous remembrance and good wishes to their affaires
out of which he was graceously pleased to recommend certaine
persons for Treasuror and Deputy if they so thought fitt, but
without any infringement of their liberty of free eleccon; and
they were further humbly requested to signify and testifie unto
his Majestie the great respect and reverence wherewith his
message was receaved and howe in conformity thereunto, although
they had formerly accordinge to their custome in their
Praeparative Court nominated the Earle of Southampton for
Treasuror, yet out of the persons recommended by his Majestie
they choose fower who had most voices and put them in eleccon
with two nominated by the Company,&mdash;upon whom the
places were conferred by an unanimous consent of the Company,
havinge founde the Plantation to prosper every of these
three last yeares more then in ten before, and [more] found to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
have bin donn with Ten thousand pounds, then formerly with
fower score thousand....</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The language of the <i>Records</i>, of course, is decorous and courtly; but
the student ought to be able to see a certain grim humor along with the
steadfast determination not to permit royal usurpation. The Ferrars'

King, he "flung away in a furious passion,"&mdash;not unnaturally. Some

and carefull eye to the same, and finding the courses taken for
the setling thereof, had not taken the good effect which Wee
intended and so much desired, did, by our Commission lately
graunted to certaine Persons of Qualitie and Trust, cause the
state of the said country of <i>Virginia</i> be to examined how it
stood, as well in point of livelihood as government; ... to
the end, yf good cause were, Wee might by our royall hand,
supply what should be defective. And whereas our Commissioners,
after much care and paines expended in execution of
our said Commissions, did certifie us, that our Subjects and
People sent to inhabite there, and to plant themselves in that
country, were most of them by God's visitations, sickness of
bodie, famine, and by massacres of them by the native savages
of the land, dead and deceased, and those that were living of
them lived in necessitie and want, and in danger by the Savages:
but the Country, for any thing appeared to the said Commissioners
to the contrary, they conceaved to be fruitfull and
healthfull after our People had been some time there; and
that if industry were used it would produce divers good and
staple Commodities, though in the sixteene years government
past, it had yealded fewe or none; ... and that yf our first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
graunt herein mentioned, and our most prudent and princely
instructions given in the beginning of the Plantation, for the
direction of the affaires thereof ... had bin pursued, much
better effect had bin produced than had bin by the alteration
thereof, into soe popular [democratic] a course ...: Whereupon
Wee entring into mature and deliberate consideration of the
premisses, did, by the advise of the Lords of our Privie Counsell,
resolve, by altering the Charters of the said Company, as
to the point of government wherein the same might be found
defective, to settle such a course as might best secure the
safetie of the People there, and cause the said Plantation to
flourish, and yet with the preservation of the interest of every
Planter or Adventurer, soe far forth as their present interests
shall not prejudice the publique Plantations; But because the
said <i>Treasurer and Company</i> did not submitt their Charters to
be reformed, our proceedings therein were stayed for a tyme,
untill, uppon a <i>Quo Warranto</i> ... by due course of Lawe, the
said charters were avoyded; [And whereas the King intends
to prepare another charter, and in the interval, by a commission
of July 15, 1629, has established a supervising council
in England for the Colony (composed of members of the Privy
Council), now, according to advice from this council] ... untill
some other constant ... course be resolved upon ...

date; 1629</i>)</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Virginia Magazine of History</i>, VII, 369.</p>

<p>For explanation, see <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 34. Sir
John Harvey had been appointed governor a few months before, with a
commission <i>which made no mention of an Assembly</i>. The extract is
No. 2 of the seven "propositions" submitted by him to King Charles.</p></div>

<p>2. That his Ma[jes]tie wilbe pleased gratiously to extend his
favour to the planters, for a new confirmation of their lands
and goods by charter under the great seale of England, and
therein to authorize the Lords to consider what is fitt to be
done for the ratifying of the privileges formerly granted, <i>and
holding of a general assembly</i>, to be called by the Governor
upon necessary occasions, therein to propound laws and orders
for the good government of the people; and for that it is most
reasonable that his ma[jes]ties subjects should be governed only
by such laws as shall have their originall from his ma[jes]ties
royall approbation, it be therefore so ordered that those laws,
so there made, only stand as propositions, until his ma[jes]tie
shalbe pleased, under his great seal or privy seal, or by the
Lords of his noble privy council, to ratify the same.</p>

Proposicons Touching Virginia</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Virginia Magazine of History</i>, VII, 370.</p></div>

<p>2. The sett[l]ing of Lands and goods and privileges is to be
done here, and may be done by calling in the former books and
charters at a convenient time. <i>But the governor may be
authorized shortly after his first coming into Virginia to call a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
grand assembly and there to set down an establishment of the
Government, and ordaine laws and orders for the good thereof</i>,
and those to send hither to receive allowance [<i>i.e.</i>, to be ratified];
and such as shall be soe allowed to be returned thither
under the great seal and put in execution, the same to be

notice thereof given unto them. And if any shall faile to
bring in the same, it is thought fitt that by virtue of this
order the said Burgesses shall have power to levy the same
by distresse, upon the goods of the delinquents, and to make
sale of the said goods, and to detaine such tobacco which
shall be due by this order, and for their ffees in making this
distresse, restoring to the owner of the said goods the residue

<p>... So have I met with greater difficultys ... here, which
in this place are no longer to be resisted, but enforce me
presently to quitt my residence and to shift to some other
warmer climate of this new world, where the wynter be
shorter and less rigorous. For here Your Majesty may please
to understand that I have found by too deare bought experience,
[what] other men for their private interests always concealed
from me, that from the middlest of October to the middlest of
May there is a sadd fare of wynter upon all this land; both
sea and land so frozen, for the greater part of the tyme, as they
are not penetrable, no plant or vegetable thing appearing out
of the earth; ... nor fish in the sea, besides the ayre so intolerable
cold as it is hardly to be endured. By means whereof,
and of much salt meate, my house hath been an hospital all
this wynter; of 100 persons, 50 sick at a time, myself being
one; and nyne or ten of them dyed. Hereupon I have had
strong temptations to leave all proceedings in plantations, and,
being much decayed in my strength, to retire myselfe to my
former quiett. But my inclination carrying me naturally to
these kynd of workes, and not knowing how better [to use]
the poore remaynder of my dayes, than ... to further ...
the enlarging your majesty's empire in this part of the world,
I am determined to committ this place to fisherman (that are
able to encounter stormes and hard weather) and to remove
myselfe with some 40 persons to your majesty's dominion
Virginia; where, if your majesty will please to grant me a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>

<h4>38. Comment on the Avalon Charter of 1623</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With the addition of two of its sections, with the necessary changes of
names, and with three or four other slight modifications, the Maryland
Charter of 1632 is an exact transcript of the <i>Charter of Avalon</i>, given in
1623 by James I to George Calvert (afterward, the first Lord Baltimore).
The Avalon Charter has been printed, the editor believes, only in Scharf's
<i>Maryland</i> (I, 34 ff.).</p>

<p>The sections of the two documents correspond up to XVIII. Sections
XVIII and XIX of the Maryland Charter (relating to subinfeudation and
manorial courts) are not found in the earlier document. Sections XVIII-XX
of the Avalon Charter correspond to XX-XXII of the Maryland
patent.</p>


<p>Other changes, aside from names, etc., are:</p>

<p>1.&mdash;(Section IV.) In the granting of advowsons and other ecclesiastical
powers, there is no reference in the Avalon Charter to the "ecclesiastical
laws of the kingdom of England." This phrase is added in the Maryland
Charter, since Baltimore has now (1624) been converted to Catholicism,
<i>probably</i> as a safeguard.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Baltimore's tenure in Avalon (&sect; 5) is to be "<i>in Capite, by Knight's
Service</i>" [not so, but in free socage, in Maryland], "yielding therefor
... a white horse, so often as we or our successors shall come into the
said region," together with the usual "fifth part of gold and silver ore."</p>

<p>3.&mdash;The Avalon Charter does not refer directly to <i>representative</i> government.
The authorization to Baltimore to publish laws runs,&mdash;"with
the advice, assent, and approbation of the Freeholders of the said Province,
or the greater part of them," while the Maryland Charter says the assent
of "the <i>Free Men</i> of the said Province, or the greater part of them, <i>or
their delegates, or deputies</i>"; but the earlier like the later charter leaves
it to the proprietor to assemble the people "in such form as to him shall
seem best," and this probably looked to a representative gathering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>4.&mdash;(XVII.) The Avalon Charter does not <i>mention</i> the participation
of the popular assembly in granting taxes. Given such an assembly, however,
and the renunciation by the English government (Section XVIII)
of that power, then the possession of the power by the Assembly would
inevitably follow. In the Maryland Charter it is <i>expressed</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Avalon Charter then, is the first <i>royal</i> patent to give to settlers in
America <i>political rights</i></b>, in addition to the private common-law privileges.
It is followed (as to sections VII and VIII) <i>in exact detail</i> by the Heath
Charter for Carolina (1629), the Baltimore Charter (1632), and the
Plowden Charter for New Albion (1634).<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Of the four grants just mentioned, that of Maryland in 1632 was the
only one under which a successful colony was established, but the others
help to show that that document was no prodigy. The student may like
to notice here one of the rare slips of Dr. Channing (<i>History of the United
States</i>, I, 245), when he ascribes the likeness between the charters of 1629,
1632, and 1634 to Sir Robert Heath's influence in that of 1629, instead of
to the earlier Avalon Charter of 1623.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hazard's <i>State Papers</i> (Washington, 1792), I, 162 ff. New Albion
was to lie north of Maryland. No settlement was effected.</p>

<p>... And forasmuch, as We have above made and ordained the before-named
Edmund Plowden, Knight, true lord and proprietor of all the
province aforesaid. <span class="smcap">Therefore</span> further know ye, that We, for Us, our
heirs, and successours, to the same Edmund, (of whose fidelity, prudence,
justice and providence, and circumspection of mind, we have full confidence)
and to his heirs, for the good and happy government of the said province,
[grant power to make, ordain, and establish] whatsoever laws, whether
concerning the public estate of the same province, or the private utility
of individuals, according to their wise discretions, and with the council,
approbation, and assents of the free tenants of the same province, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>major part of them who shall be called together by the aforesaid Edmund
Plowden, and his heirs, to make laws when, and as often as there shall
be occasion, in such form as to him or them shall seem best. ... And
because, in so large a province it may often happen, that there will be
a necessity to provide a remedy in a number of cases, before the free
tenants of the said province can be assembled to make laws, nor will it
be proper to delay in a case of emergency, until so many people can be
called together. <span class="smcap">Therefore</span>, for the better government of the said province,
we will, and ordain, and by these presents, for Us, our heirs, and
successors, grant unto the before-named Edmund Plowden, and to his
heirs, that the aforesaid Edmund Plowden, and his heirs, by themselves,
or by magistrates and officers in that behalf, to be duly constituted as
aforesaid, fit and wholesome ordinations from time to time, shall and
may be able to make and constitute, to be kept and preferred within
the province aforesaid, as well for keeping the peace as for the better
government of the people there living or inhabiting, and to give public
notice of them to all persons whom the same doth or may concern; which
said ordinations We will, shall be inviolably observed within the said
province, under the penalties in the same expressed. So that the same
ordinances be consonant to reason, and be not repugnant nor contrary,
but as much agreeable as may be to the laws, statutes, and rights of our
kingdoms of England and Ireland. And so as that the same ordinances
do not extend themselves to the right or interest of any person or persons,
of, or in free tenements, or the taking, distraining, binding, or charging
any of their goods or chattles....</p></div>

<h4>41. Weymouth's Voyage, 1605</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From <i>A True Relation of Captain George Waymouth, His Voyage</i>
(1605), reprinted in Massachusetts Historical Society Collections, Vol.
VIII. Weymouth's voyage was a precursor of the attempt at settlement
on the Kennebec in 1607 by one branch of the Virginia Company.</p></div>


<p>Upon Tuesday, <i>the 5th day of March</i>, about ten o'clock before
noon, we set sail from Ratcliffe, and came to an anchor
that tide about two o'clock before Gravesend....</p>

<p>Friday, <i>the 17th of May</i>, about six o'clock at night, we descried
the land. ... It appeared a mean high land, as we
after found it, being an island of some six miles in compass,
but I hope the most fortunate ever yet discovered....</p>

<p>This island is woody grown with fir, birch, oak and beech,
as far as we saw along the shore; and so likely to be within.
On the verge grow gooseberries, strawberries, wild pease, and
wild rose bushes. The water issued forth down the rocky
cliffe in many places: and much fowl of divers kinds breed
upon the shore and rocks.</p>

<p>While we were at shore, our men aboard, with a few hooks,
got above thirty great cods and haddocks, which gave us a
taste of the great plenty of fish which we found afterward
wheresoever we went upon the coast. From hence we might
discern the main land from the west-south-west to the east-north-east;
and a great way (as it then seemed, and we after
found it,) up into the main we might discern very high mountains,
though the main seemed but low land;...</p>

<p>The profits and fruits which are naturally on these islands
are these:</p>

<p>All along the shore, and some space within, where the wood
hindereth not, grow plentifully, raspberries, gooseberries,
strawberries, roses, currants, wild vines, angelica.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Within the islands grow wood of sundry sorts, some very
great, and all tall, as birch, beech, ash, maple, spruce, cherry
tree, yew, oak, very great and good, fir tree, out of which
issueth turpentine in so marvellous plenty, and so sweet as
our chirurgeon and others affirmed they never saw so good in
England. We pulled off much gum, congealed on the outside
of the bark, which smelled like frankincense. This would be
a great benefit for making tar and pitch.</p>

<p>We staid the longer in this place, not only because of our
good harbor (which is an excellent comfort,) but because every
day we did more and more discover the pleasant fruitfulness;
insomuch as many of our company wished themselves settled
here, not expecting any further hopes, or better discovery to
be made.</p>

<p>Here our men found abundance of great muscles among the
rocks; and in some of them many small pearls: and in one
muscle (which we drew up in our net) was found fourteen
pearls, whereof one of pretty bigness and orient; in another
above fifty small pearls: and if we had had a drag, no doubt
we had found some of great value, seeing these did certainly
shew that here they were bred; the shells all glittering with
mother of pearl....</p>

<p>Our captain had in this small time discovered up a great
river, trending alongst into the main about forty miles. The
pleasantness whereof, with the safety of harbor for shipping,
together with the fertility of ground and other fruits, which
were generally by his whole company related, I omit till I report
of the whole discovery thereinafter performed....</p>

<p>The next day being Saturday and the first of June, I traded
with the savages all the forenoon upon the shore, where were
eight-and-twenty of them; and because our ship rode nigh, we
were but five or six; where for knives, glasses, combs, and
other trifles to the value of four or five shillings, we had forty
good beavers' skins, otters' skins, sables, and other small skins,
which we knew not how to call. ... Here are more good harbors
for ships of all burthens, than England can afford, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
far more secure from all winds and weathers, than any in
England, Scotland, France, or Spain....</p>

<p>As we passed with a gentle wind up with our ship in this
river, any man may conceive with what admiration we all consented
in joy. Many of our company who had been travellers
in sundry countries, and in most famous rivers, yet affirmed
them not comparable to this they now beheld. Some that
were with Sir Walter Raleigh in his voyage to Guiana, in the
discovery of the river Orenoque, which echoed fame to the
world's ears, gave reasons why it was not to be compared with
this, which wanteth the dangers of many shoals, and broken
ground, wherewith that was incumbered. Others before that
notable river in the West Indies called Rio Grande; some before
the river of Loire, the river Seine, and of Bourdeaux in
France; which although they be great and goodly rivers, yet it
is no detraction from them to be accounted inferior to this,
which not only yieldeth all the foresaid pleasant profits, but
also appeared infallibly to us free from all inconveniences.</p>

<p>I will not prefer it before our river of Thames, because it is
England's richest treasure:...</p>

<p>The excellency of this part of the river, for his good breadth,
depth, and fertile bordering ground, did so ravish us all with
variety of pleasantness, as we could not tell what to commend,
but only admired; some compared it to the river Severn, (but
in a higher degree) and we all concluded (as I verily think we
might right) that we should never see the like river in every
degree equal, until it pleased God we beheld the same
again....</p>

<p>The temperature of the climate (albeit a very important
matter) I had almost passed without mentioning, because it
afforded to us no great alteration from our disposition in
England; somewhat hotter up into the main, because it lieth
open to the south; the air so wholesome, as I suppose not any
of us found ourselves at any time more healthful, more able to
labor, nor with better stomachs to such good fare as we partly
brought and partly found....</p>

<h4>42. Charter of the Plymouth Council</h4>

<p class="center">[Often called The Council for New England]</p>

<p class="center">November 3/12, 1629</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hazard's <i>State Papers</i> (Washington, 1792), I, 103-118.</p>

<p>The "Second Colony" of the Charter of 1606 (No. 16 above) sent out
an expedition to the coast of Maine in 1607. This failed; and the Company
made no further efforts until 1620, save for the vain attempt of Sir
Ferdinando Gorges, one of the leading members. In March of 1619/20,
Gorges and other members petitioned for a reorganization of the Company,
and this prayer was granted by the King in this charter. This document
stands to the "Second Colony" of 1606 (the Plymouth branch) as do the
charters of 1609 and 1612 to the "First Colony" (the London branch).</p></div>


<p>[The charter begins by reciting the grant of the Virginia
Charter of 1606, the grant of 1609 to one branch of the original
Company, and the petition of Gorges and others of the Plymouth
branch for a similar enlargement and for a monopoly of the
northern fisheries.]</p>

<p>And also for that We have been further given certainly to
knowe, that within these late Yeares there hath by God's
Visitation raigned a wonderfull Plague, together with many
horrible Slaughters, and Murthers, committed amongst the
Savages and bruitish People there heertofore inhabiting, in a
Manner to the utter Destruction, Devastacion, and Depopulacion
of that whole Territorye ... whereby We in our Judgment are
persuaded and satisfied that the appointed Time is come in
which Almighty God in his great Goodness and Bountie
towards Us and our People, hath thought fitt and determined
that those large and goodly Territoryes, deserted as it were by
their naturall inhabitants, should be possessed and enjoyed by
such of our Subjects and People as heertofore have and here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>after
shall by his Mercie and Favour, and by his Powerfull
Arme, be directed and conducted thither. In Contemplacion and
serious Consideracion whereof, Wee have thougt it fitt according
to our Kingly Duty, soe much as in Us lyeth, to second and
followe God's sacred Will, rendering reverend Thanks to his
Divine Majestie for his gracius favour in laying open and revealing
the same unto us before any other Christian Prince or
State, by which Meanes without Offence, ... Wee therefore ...
Do ... grant ... that all that Circuit, Continent, Precincts,
and Limitts in America, lying and being in Breadth from Fourty
Degrees of Northerly Latitude, from the Equinoticall Line, to
Fourty-eight Degrees of the said Northerly Latitude, and in
Length by all the Breadth aforesaid throughout the Maine Land,
from Sea to Sea, ... shall be the Limitts ... of the second
Collony: And to the End that the said Territoryes may forever
hereafter be more particularly and certainly known and distinguished,
our Will and Pleasure is, that the same shall from
henceforth be nominated, termed, and called by the Name of
New-England, in America. ... And for the better Plantacion,
ruling, and governing of the aforesaid New-England in America,
We ... ordaine ... that from henceforth, there shall
be ... in our Towne of Plymouth, in the County of Devon,
one Body politicque and corporate, which shall have perpetuall
Succession, which shall consist of the Number of fourtie
Persons, and no more, which shall be, and shall be called and
knowne by the Name of the Council established at Plymouth, in
the County of Devon, for the planting, ruling, ordering, and
governing of New-England, in America; [The names of the
Council. They have power to fill vacancies in their membership,
and the usual rights of a corporation; they are to choose a
"President," etc.; and to control trade with New England and
the ownership of land.]</p>

<p>And further ... Wee ... grant full Power and Authority
to the said Councill ... [to] nominate, make, constitute, ordaine,
and confirme by such Name or Names, Style or Styles, as
to them shall seeme Good; and likewise to revoke, discharge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
change, and alter, as well all and singular, Governors, Officers,
and Ministers, which hereafter shall be by them thought fitt
and needful to be made or used, as well to attend the Business
of the said Company here, as for the Government of the said
Collony and Plantation, and also to make ... all Manner of
Orders, Laws, Directions, Instructions, Forms, and Ceremonies
of Government and Magistracy fitt and necessary for any concerning
the Government of the said Collony and Plantation,
so always as the same be not contrary to the Laws and Statutes
of this our Realme of England; and the same att all Times
hereafter to abrogate, revoke, or change, not only within the
Precincts of the said Collony, but also upon the Seas in going
and coming to and from the said Collony, as they in their good
Discretions shall thinke to be fittest for the good of the
Adventurers and Inhabitants there.</p>

<p>[Clauses similar to those in the London Company's charter
of 1609 regarding martial law; the forfeiture of goods fraudulently
transported to a foreign country; landholding by free
socage, etc.; the right "to take, load, carry, and transport ...
out of our Realmes to New England all such ... of our loveing
Subjects ... as shall willingly accompany them"; exemption
from duties on goods exported from England for seven years;
and from all taxes for twenty-one years, except the five per
cent customs duty for imports to be re&euml;xported; right to dispose
of lands.]</p>

<p>And Wee do also ... grant to the said Councell ... that
they ... shall, and lawfully may, ... for their ... Defence
and Safety, encounter, expulse, repel, and resist by Force
of Arms, as well by Sea as by Land, and all Ways and
Meanes whatsoever, all such ... Persons, as without the
speciall Licence of the said Councell ... shall attempt to inhabitt
within the said severall Precincts and Limitts of the
said Collony and Plantation. And also all ... such ...
Persons ... as shall enterprize or attempt att any time hereafter
Destruction, Invasion, Detriment, or Annoyance to the
said Collony and Plantation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>[A like provision for use of force to prevent traders visiting
the territory without the "License and consent of the said
Councill ... first had and obtained in Writing." Authority
for two of the Council to administer the oaths of allegiance and
supremacy (as in the charter of 1612); a long passage giving
the Councill extraordinary jurisdiction as a safeguard against
its being defrauded or libeled (as in the charter of 1612);
English subjects settling in the colony and their descendants
there to have all the rights of Englishmen. None to be permitted
to go to New England except such as first take the oath
of supremacy,&mdash;this provision intended to exclude Catholics
(wording taken from the charter of 1609; not found in 1612);
etc, etc. etc.&mdash;Privileges granted in 1606, and not altered in
this charter, are confirmed.]</p>

<h4>43. Delays in securing the Wincob Charter<br />

Robert Cushman to Pastor Robinson, May 8/18, 1619</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bradford's <i>Plymouth Plantation</i> (Original Narratives edition), 58, 59.</p>

<p>Cushman was the agent of the Pilgrims, sent from Holland to secure
a charter from the London Company for some district in "Northern
Virginia." The negotiations had been going on more than a year when
this letter was written.</p></div>

<p>... The maine hinderance of our proseedings in the Virginia
bussines is the dissentions and factions as they terme
it among the Counsell and Company of Virginia; which are
such as that ever since we came up no busines could by
them be dispatched. The occasion of this trouble amongst
them is, for that a while since Sir Thomas Smith, repining
at his many offices and troubls, wished the Company of Virginia
to ease him of his office. ... Wereupon the Company
tooke occasion to dismisse him and choose Sir Edwin Sands
Treasurer and Goverr of the Company. He having 60 voyces,
Sir John Worstenholme 16 voices, and Alderman Johnson
21.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But Sir Thomas Smith when he saw some parte of
his honour lost, was very angrie, and raised a faction to
cavill and contend aboute the election, and sought to taxe Sir
Edwin with many things that might both disgrace him,
and allso put him by his office of Governour. In which
contentions they yet stick and are not fit nor readie to intermedle
in any bussines; and what issue things will come to
we are not yet certaine. It is most like Sir Edwin will carrie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
it, and if he doe, things will goe well<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> in Virginia, if otherwise,

<h4>44. Agreement between the Pilgrims in Holland and the Merchant
Adventurers in London</h4>

<p class="center">July 1/11, 1620</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bradford's <i>Plymouth Plantation</i> (Original Narratives edition), 66, 67.</p>

<p>The following "articles" outline the business partnership by which
the Pilgrims secured funds to come to America.</p></div>

<p>1.&mdash;The adventurers and planters doe agree that every
person that goeth, being aged 16 years and upward, be rated at
10 &pound;, and ten pounds to be accounted a single share.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;That he that goeth in person, and furnisheth him selfe
out with 10 &pound; either in money or other provissions, be accounted
as having 20 &pound; in stock, and in the devission shall
receive a double share.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;The persons transported and the adventurers shall continue
their joynt stock and partnership togeather the space of 7
years (excepte some unexpected impedimente doe cause the
whole company to agree otherwise), during which time all
profits and benefits that are gott by trade, traffick, trucking,
working, fishing, or any other means of any person or persons,
remaine still in the commone stock untill the division.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;That at their comming ther, they chose out such a
number of fitt persons, as may furnish their ships and boats
for fishing upon the sea; imploying the rest in their severall
faculties upon the land; as building houses, tilling, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
planting the ground, and makeing shuch commodities as shall
be most usefull for the collonie.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;That at the end of the 7 years, the capitall and profits,&mdash;viz.
the houses, lands, goods and chatles,&mdash;be equally devided
betwixte the adventurers and planters; which done, every
man shall be free from other of them of any debt or detrimente
concerning this adventure.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;Whosoever cometh to the colonie herafter, or putteth
any into the stock, shall at the ende of the 7 years be alowed
proportionably to the time of his so doing.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;He that shall carie his wife and children, or servants,
shall be alowed for everie person now aged 16 years and upward,
a single share in the devision, or if he provid them
necessaries, a duble share, or if they be between 10 year old
and 16, then 2 of them to be reconed for a person, both in
transportation and devision.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;That such children as now goe, and are under the age
of ten years, have noe other shar in the devision but 50 acers
of unmanured land.</p>

<p>9.&mdash;That such persons as die before the 7 years be expired,
their executors to have their parte or sharr at the devison,
proportionably to the time of their life in the collonie.</p>

<p>10.&mdash;That all such persons as are of this collonie, are to
have their meate, drink, apparell, and all provissions out of
the common stock and goods of the said collonie.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Bradford adds: "The cheefe and principall differences between these
and the former conditions [<i>i.e.</i> articles proposed at first by the Pilgrims]
stood in these 2 points; that the houses and lands improved, espetialy
gardens and home lotts, should remain undevided wholly to the planters
at the 7 years end [<i>i.e.</i> not go into the common stock of the partnership]
2ly, that they should have had 2 days in a weeke for their own private
imploymente."</p>

<p>These points are made in a letter of John Robinson, the Pilgrim
pastor, to John Carver, the agent in England, dated July 14, 1620 (Bradford,
69, 70).</p>

<p>"Aboute the conditions ... let this spetially be borne in minde;
that the greatest parte of the collonie is like to be imployed constantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
not upon dressing ther perticuler [individual] land, and building houses,
<i>but upon fishing</i>, <i>trading</i>, etc. So as the land and house will be but a
trifell for advantage to the adventurers [London capitalists]; and yet the
devission of it a great discouragemente to the planters [colonists], who
would with singuler care make it comfortable with borowed houres from
their sleep."</p>

<p>For the fallacy in this view, cf. <i>American History and Government</i>,
&sect;&sect; 49, 52.]</p></div>


<h4>45. From the Farewell Letter of John Robinson</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bradford's <i>Plymouth Plantation</i> (Original Narratives edition), 84-86.</p>

<p>Robinson was the pastor of the Separatist congregation at Leyden.
This letter was written to that part of the congregation which had just
embarked for America, soon to found Plymouth colony. It is not dated.
Bradford gives the full text. This extract shows that the charter which
the Pilgrims had secured from the London Company, but which they
were never to use (No. 43 note, and <i>American History and Government</i>,
&sect; 51 note), had guaranteed them a large measure of self-government.
The letter would fill some five pages of this book.</p></div>

<p>... Lastly, whereas you are become a body politik, using
amongst yourselves civill governmente, and are not furnished
with any persons of spetiall eminence above the rest, to be
chosen by you into office, let your wisdome and godlines appear,
not only in chusing shuch persons as do entirely love and
will promote the commone good, but also in yeelding unto
them all due honour and obedience ... and this dutie you
may the more willingly ... performe, because you are at
least for the present to have onely them for your ordinarie
governours which your selves shall make choyse of for that
worke.</p>

much as a preliminary "social compact." Nineteen years later, Wheelwright
and his followers (banished from Massachusetts) settled on the
New Hampshire coast and adopted an agreement similar to the Mayflower
document in occasion and character. Western mining camps have taken
like action many times in later days.</p>

<p><i>Massachusetts Historical Society Collections</i>, Fourth Series, II, 158 ff.</p>

<p>Finding themselves within the jurisdiction of the newly reorganized
Plymouth Council (or New England Council), the Pilgrims secured from
that body the following grant through their London partners. Peirce
was intended to act as trustee while the partnership lasted. Cf. <i>American
History and Government</i>, &sect; 55, and (for the documents regarding Peirce's
later attempt to steal the colony) Arber's <i>Story of the Pilgrim Fathers</i>,

Hospitalls, Toune houses, Bridges, and such like workes of
Charytie, As also for the maynteyning of Magistrates and

<p>[The above grant was the first charter issued by the Plymouth Council
of 1620 (No. 42 above). It is sometimes said that these patents from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the Council had no legal force, so far as <i>political features</i> were concerned.
It is true that such grants had no force, as against the royal government;
but, as long as the royal grant to the Council stood, grants from that
body were valid,&mdash;certainly valid as against any later claim from that
proprietary body. The king's patent of 1620 authorized the Council to
arrange the government of colonies in its New England territories as it
pleased. In carrying out this provision for the Pilgrims, the Council saw
fit to permit a large share of self-government,&mdash;just as the London
Company had done, in less degree, for the Virginians, and as Penn was
to do for the Pennsylvanians in his famous charter to them in 1701 (No.
109 below). As to the overthrow of the validity of the charters to the
Pilgrims in 1634, cf. <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 55 close.]</p></div>

<p>Arber's <i>Story of the Pilgrim Fathers</i>, 488-494. (The spelling is

<p>Loving and Old Friend,&mdash;</p>

<p>Although I received no letter from you by this ship, yet
forasmuch as I know you expect the performance of my
promise, which was, to write unto you truly and faithfully
of all things, I have therefore at this time sent unto you accordingly,
referring you for further satisfaction to our more
large Relations [Winslow's <i>Relations</i>, a considerable volume].</p>

<p>You shall understand that in this little time [less than one
year] that a few of us have been here, we have built seven
dwelling-houses and four for the use of the plantation, and
have made preparation for divers others. We set the last
spring some twenty acres of Indian corn, and sowed some six
acres of barley and pease; and according to the manner of the
Indians, we manured our ground with herrings, or rather
shads, which we have in great abundance, and take with great
ease at our doors. Our corn did prove well; and, God be
praised, we had a good increase of Indian corn, and our barley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
indifferent good, but our pease not worth the gathering, for we
feared they were too late sown. They came up very well, and
blossomed; but the sun parched them in the blossom....</p>

<p>When it pleaseth God we are settled and fitted for the
fishing business and other trading, I doubt not but by the
blessing of God the gain will give content to all. In the
mean time, that we have gotten we have sent by this ship;
and though it be not much, yet it will witness for us that we
have not been idle, considering the smallness of our number
all this summer. We hope the merchants will accept of it,
and be encouraged to furnish us with things needful for
further employment, which will also encourage us to put forth
ourselves to the uttermost.</p>

<p>Now because I expect your coming unto us, with other of
our friends, whose company we much desire, I thought good
to advertise you of a few things needful. Be careful to have
a very good bread-room to put your biscuits in. Let your cask
for beer and water be iron-bound, for the first tire, if not more.
Let not your meat be dry-salted; none can better do it than
the sailors. Let your meal be so hard trod in your cask that
you shall need an adz or hatchet to work it out with. Trust
not too much on us for corn at this time, for by reason of this
last company that came, depending wholly upon us, we shall
have little enough till harvest. Be careful to come by some
of your meal to spend by the way; it will much refresh you.
Build your cabins as open as you can, and bring good store of
clothes and bedding with you. Bring every man a mussket or
fowling-piece. Let your piece be long in the barrel, and fear
not the weight of it, for most of our shooting is from stands.
Bring juice of lemons, and take it fasting; it is of good use.
For hot waters, aniseed water is the best; but use it sparingly.
If you bring anything for comfort in the country, butter or
sallet oil, or both is very good. Our Indian corn, even the
coarsest, maketh us pleasant meat as rice; therefore spare
that, unless to spend by the way. Bring paper and linseed
oile for your windows, with cotton yarn for your lamps. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
your shot be most for big fowls, and bring store of powder
and shot. I forbear further to write for the present, hoping
to see you by the next return. So I take my leave, commending
you to the Lord for a safe conduct unto us, resting in him,</p>

<h5><i>b. Captain John Smith's Account, 1624</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Smith's <i>Works</i> (Birmingham edition), 782 ff.</p></div>

<p>At New-Plimoth there is [1624] about 180 persons, some
cattell and goats, but many swine and poultry; 32 dwelling
houses, whereof 7 were burnt the last winter [1623], and the
value of five hundred pounds in other goods; the Towne is
impailed about halfe a mile [in] compasse. In the toune
upon a high Mount they have a Fort well built with wood,
lime, and stone, where is planted their Ordnance: Also a
faire Watch-tower, partly framed for the Sentinell. The
place it seemes is healthfull, for in these last three yeeres
[1621-4], notwithstanding their great want of most necessaries,
there hath not one died of the first planters. They
have made a saltworke, and with that salt preserve the fish
they take; and this yeare [1624] hath fraughted a ship of
180 tunnes.</p>

<p>The Governour is one Master William Bradford;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The most of them live together as one family or household,
yet every man followeth his trade and profession both by sea
and land, and all for a generall stocke: out of which they
have all their maintenance, untill there be a divident betwixt
the Planters and the Adventurers.</p>

<p>Those Planters are not servants to the Adventurers here,
but have onely councells of directions from them, but no injunctions
or command; and all the masters of families are
partners in land or whatsoever, setting their labours against
the stocke, till certaine yeeres be expired for the division;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
they have young men and boies for their Apprentises and
servants, and some of them speciall families, as Ship-carpenters,
Salt-makers, Fish-masters, yet as servants upon great wages.</p>

<p>The Adventurers which raised the stocke to begin and
supply this Plantation were about 70:<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> some Gentlemen, some
Merchants, some handy-crafts men, some adventuring great
summes, some small, as their estates and affection served.
The generall stocke already imploied is about 7000 l.; by
reason of which charge and many crosses, many of them
would adventure no more: but others that knowes so great
a designe cannot bee effected without both charge, losse, and
crosses, are resolved to goe forward with it to their powers;
which deserve no small commendations and encouragement.
These [The Adventurers generally] dwell most[ly] about
London. They are not a Corporation, but [are] knit together
by a voluntary combination in a society without constraint
or penalty, aiming to doe good and to plant Religion; they
have a President and Treasurer, every yeere newly chosen
by the most voices, who ordereth the affaires of their Courts
and meetings, and with the assent of the most of them, undertaketh
all ordinary business; but in more weighty affaires,
the assent of the whole Company is required.</p>

<p>There hath beene a fishing this yeere [1624] upon the
Coast about 50. English ships: ... and though I promise
no Mines of gold, yet the warlike Hollanders let us imitate
but not hate, whose wealth and strength are good testimonies
of their treasury gotten by fishing; and New-England hath
yeelded already [up to 1624] by generall computation one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
hundred thousand pounds at the least. Therefore, honourable
and worthy Country men, let not the meannesse of the word
fish distaste you, for it will afford as good gold as the Mines
of Guiana or Potassie, with lesse hazard and charge, and more
certainty and facility.</p>

the prisoner shall have liberty (according to the law of England)
to except against twenty of the jury without giving any

promise of the Planters in 1627 "to pay them for nine years two hundred

<p>[Sir Ferdinando Gorges was one of the original patentees of the "Northern
Colony" of 1606. More than any other one man, he was instrumental
in keeping that enterprise alive and in finally securing its reorganization
as the Council of New England in 1620 (No. 42 above). He continued
to be prominent in the meetings and business of that Company until its
dissolution in 1634. He drew up a plan of government for all New
England, in accordance with which the New England Council appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
his son Robert "generall Governor." This governor was to be assisted
by a "Councill" consisting of heads of any individual colonies established
or to be established. The Governor and Council were to make laws with
the assent of a central "Parliament" to be chosen from the several
colonies.</p>

<p>Thus Robert Gorges came to America in this double capacity,&mdash;patentee
of his own small grant on Massachusetts Bay, and General
Governor (or "Lieutenant General") of all New England. It was
this last position that brought upon him the dislike of Governor Bradford
of Plymouth, as noted in <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 45,
note.]</p></div>

<p>The several complaints made to the council of the abuses
committed by several the fishermen, and other interlopers, who
without order from them frequented those coasts, tending to
the scorn of our nation ... to the overthrow of our trade, and
dishonor of the government,&mdash;</p>

<p>For reformation whereof, and to prevent the evils that may
ensue, they were pleased to resolve of the sending some one
into those parts as their Lieutenant, to regulate the estate of
their affairs and those abuses. Hereupon my son Robert Gorges
being newly come out of the Venetian war, was the man they
were pleased to pitch upon, being one of the Company, and interested
in a proportion of the land with the rest of the Patentees
in the Bay of the Majechewsett, containing ten miles in
breadth and thirty miles into the main land; who, between my
Lord Gorges and myself, was speedily sent away into the said
Bay of Massechewset, where he arrived about the beginning of
August following, anno 1623, that being the place he resolved
to make his residence, as proper for the public as well as for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
private [affairs]; where landing his provisions and building his
storehouses, he sent to them of New Plymouth (who by his commission
were authorized to be his assistants) to come unto him,
who willingly obeyed his order, and as carefully discharged
their duties; by whose experience he suddenly understood
what was to be done with the poor means he had, believing the
supplies he expected would follow according to the undertakings
of divers his familiar friends who had promised as much.
But they, hearing how I sped in the House of Parliament, withdrew
themselves; and myself and friends were wholly disabled
to do any thing to purpose. The report of these proceedings
with us coming to my son's ears, he was advised to return home
till better occasion should offer itself unto him.</p>

<p>For explanation of White's connection with the Company, see <i>American
History and Government</i>, &sect; 57 and note.</p></div>

<p>The ensuing faithful and impartial narration of the first
occasions, beginning, and progress of the whole work, is laid
before the eyes of all that desire to receive satisfaction, by
such as have been privy to the very first conceiving and contriving
of this project of planting this Colony....</p>

<p>About ten years since, a company of English, part out of
the Low Countries, and some out of London and other parts,
associating themselves into one body, with an intention to
plant in Virginia, in their passage thither being taken short
by the wind, in the depth of winter, the whole ground being
under snow, were forced with their provisions to land themselves
in New-England, upon a small bay beyond Mattachusets,
in the place which they now inhabit, and call by the name of
New Plymouth. The ground being covered a foot thick with
snow, and they being without shelter, and having amongst
them divers women and children, no marvel if they lost some
of their company; it may be wondered how they saved the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
rest. But notwithstanding this sharp encounter at the first,
and some miscarriages afterward, yet, conceiving God's providence
had directed them unto that place, and finding great
charge and difficulty in removing, they resolved to fix themselves
there; and being assisted by some of their friends in
London, having passed over most of the greatest difficulties
that usually encounter new planters, they began to subsist at
length in a reasonably comfortable manner; being, notwithstanding,
men but of mean and weak estates of themselves;
and after a year's experience or two of the soil and inhabitants,
sent home tidings of both, and of their well-being there, which
occasioned other men to take knowledge of the place, and to
take it into consideration.</p>

<p>About the year 1623, some western merchants, who had continued
a trade of fishing for cod and bartering for furs in those
parts for divers years before, conceiving that a Colony planted
on the coast might further them in those employments, bethought
themselves how they might bring that project to effect,
and communicated their purpose to others, alleging the conveniency
of compassing their project with a small charge, by
the opportunity of their fishing trade, in which they accustomed
to double-man their ships, that, by the help of many
hands, they might dispatch their voyage and lade their ship
with fish while the fishing season lasted; which could not be
done with a bare sailing company. Now it was conceived that,
the fishing being ended, the spare men that were above their
necessary sailors, might be left behind with provisions for a
year; and when that ship returned the next year, they might
assist them in fishing, as they had done the former year; and,
in the mean time, might employ themselves in building, and
planting corn, which, with the provisions of fish, fowl, and
venison, that the land yielded, would afford them the chief of
their food. This proposition of theirs took so well, that it
drew on divers persons to join with them in this project; the
rather because it was conceived, that not only their own fishermen,
but the rest of our nation that went thither on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
errand, might be much advantaged, not only by fresh victual,
which that Colony might spare them in time, but withal, and
more, by the benefit of their ministers' labors, which they
might enjoy during the fishing season; whereas otherwise,
being usually upon those voyages nine or ten months in the
year, they were left all the while without any means of instruction
at all. Compassion towards the fishermen, and
partly some expectation of gain, prevailed so far that for the
planting of a Colony in New England there was raised a stock
of more than &pound;3000, intended to be paid in in five years, but
afterwards disbursed in a shorter time.</p>

<p>How this stock was employed, and by what errors and oversights
it was wasted, is, I confess, not much pertinent to this
subject in hand. Notwithstanding, because the knowledge
there of may be of use for other mens' direction, let me crave
leave, in a short digression, to present unto the reader's view
the whole order of the managing of such moneys as were collected,
with the success and issue of the business undertaken.
[Here follows an account of mismanagement and losses, and
the failure of the Company.]</p>

<p>But to return to our former subject, from which we digressed.
Upon the manifestation of the Western Adventurers'
resolution to give off their work, most part of the land men,
being sent for, returned. But a few of the most honest and
industrious resolved to stay behind, and to take charge of the
cattle sent over the year before; which they performed accordingly.
And not liking their seat at Cape Anne, chosen
especially for the supposed commodity of fishing, they transported
themselves to Nahum-Keike, about four or five leagues
distant to the southwest from Cape Anne.</p>

<p>Some then of the Adventurers, that still continued their
desire to set forward the plantation of a Colony there, conceiving
that if some more cattle were sent over to those few men left
behind, they might not only be a means of the comfortable
subsisting of such as were already in the country, but of
inviting some others of their friends and acquaintance to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
over to them, adventured to send over twelve kine and bulls
more; and, conferring casually with some gentlemen of London,
moved them to add unto them as many more. By which
occasion, the business came to agitation afresh in London, and
being at first approved by some and disliked by others, by
argument and disputation it grew to be more vulgar; insomuch
that some men showing some good affection to the work, and
offering the help of their purses if fit men might be procured
to go over, inquiry was made whether any would be willing to
engage their persons in the voyage. By this inquiry it fell
out that among others they lighted at last on Master Endecott,
a man well known to divers persons of good note, who manifested
much willingness to accept of the offer as soon as it was
tendered; which gave great encouragement to such as were
upon the point of resolution to set on this work of erecting a
new Colony upon the old foundation. Hereupon divers persons
having subscribed for the raising of a reasonable sum of money,
a patent was granted with large encouragements every way by
his most excellent Majesty. Master Endecott was sent over
Governor<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> assisted with a few men, and arriving in safety
there in September, 1628, and uniting his own men with those
which were formerly planted in the country into one body,
they made up in all not much above fifty or sixty persons.</p>

<p>His prosperous journey, and safe arrival of himself and all
his company, and good report which he sent back of the country,
gave such encouragement to the work, that more adventurers
joining with the first undertakers, and all engaging themselves
more deeply for the prosecution of the design, they sent over
the next year about three hundred persons more, most servants,
with a convenient proportion of rotherbeasts, to the number
of sixty or seventy, or there about, and some mares and horses;
of which the kine came safe for the most part, but the greater
part of the horses died, so that there remained not above
twelve or fourteen alive.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>
<p>By this time the often agitation of this affair in sundry
parts of the kingdom, the good report of Captain Endecott's
government, and the increase of the Colony, began to waken
the spirits of some persons of competent estates, not formerly
engaged. Considering that they lived either without any
useful employment at home, and might be more serviceable in
assisting the planting of a Colony in New England, [they] took
at last a resolution to unite themselves for the prosecution of
that work. And, as it usually falls out, some other of their
acquaintance, seeing such men of good estates engaged in
the voyages, some for love to their persons, and others upon
other respects, united unto them; which together made up a
competent number, (perhaps far less than is reported,) and
embarked themselves for a voyage to New-England, where I
hope they are long since safely arrived [a reference to John
Winthrop's expedition].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is an impartial though brief relation of the occasion of
planting of this Colony. The particulars whereof, if they
could be entertained, were clear enough to any indifferent
judgment, that the suspicious and scandalous reports raised
upon these gentlemen and their friends, (as if, under the color
of planting a Colony, they intended to raise and erect a seminary
of faction and separation,) are nothing else but the fruits
of jealousy of some distempered mind, or, which is worse,
perhaps, savor of a desperate malicious plot of men ill affected
to religion, endeavoring, by casting the undertakers into the
jealousy of State, to shut them out of those advantages which
otherwise they do and might expect from the countenance of
authority. Such men would be intreated to forbear that base
and unchristian course of traducing innocent persons under
these odious names of Separatists and enemies to the Church
and State, for fear lest their own tongues fall upon themselves
by the justice of His hand who will not fail to clear the innocency
of the just, and to cast back into the bosom of every
slanderer the filth that he rakes up to throw in other men's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
faces. As for men of more indifferent and better tempered
minds, they would be seriously advised to beware of entertaining
and admitting, much more countenancing and crediting
such uncharitable persons as discover themselves by their
carriage, and that in this particular, to be men ill affected
towards the work itself, if not to religion, at which it aims,
and consequently unlikely to report any truth of such as
undertake it.</p>

<p>[<b>Hints for Study.</b>&mdash;1.&mdash;Early New England historians <i>assumed</i> that this
charter gave unusual powers. A comparison with the Virginia Company
charters of 1609 and 1612, or with the New England Council charter of
1620, shows this assumption wholly false. Students may be asked to find
four important powers given to those earlier corporations and not contained
in this grant (noting the <i>limited</i> authority here in the inflictions of
punishment, and the omission of the power to regulate settlement in connection
with the usual "expulse, repel, etc." clause). The charter is
not "very liberal," but very limited. This is more apparent when we
notice that all these powers missing in this charter (or vaguely phrased
here) <i>reappear</i> in the usual explicit form in the charter granted a few
months later to the company for planting Providence Isle (No. 55,
below).</p>

<p>2.&mdash;American historians (<i>e.g.</i> John Fiske, in <i>Beginnings of New England</i>)
have often assumed that this charter used loose language as to the
oath of supremacy <i>in order that</i> the Puritans might set up their own form
of worship. <i>The wording, however, is practically identical with that of the
Virginia Company charter of 1612&mdash;from which unquestionably it was
copied</i>, with only the necessary changes of names. (Let students verify
this statement.)</p>

<p>3.&mdash;With the overthrow of these false assumptions goes another (in
great measure) founded upon them,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> that the Puritans intended,
when they were securing this charter, to bring it to America and use it as
a constitution for a free state. This assumption, however, is worth further
investigation by the student, because it offers so admirable a lesson
in historical criticism.</p>

<p>A single sentence of Governor John Winthrop's has been taken often
as sufficient proof that the grantees so intended. Indeed (except for the
groundless assumptions of 1 and 2 above, and for the equally worthless
consideration discussed in 4 below) there is <i>no other evidence</i>.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>throp
states that, in drawing up the charter, there was at first a clause
which would have fixed the Company in England, "and, with much
difficulty, <i>we</i> got it abscinded." Winthrop is high authority. But this
sentence was written <b>fifteen years after the event</b>, and it is interjected
hastily, <i>as a parenthesis</i>, in a bitter controversy (<i>Life and Letters</i>, II,
p. 443). It could have been only "hearsay" at the best; since Winthrop
did not belong to the Company until some months after the charter
was secured (though he seems to have forgotten that for the moment
when he says "we"). Such evidence would prove little in a law court,
even if there were no evidence on the other side.</p>

<p>But there is evidence on the other side,&mdash;abundant, conclusive, unimpeachable.</p>

<p>(1) The abstract of the charter (docket) presented to the king by his
legal advisors shows with absolute certainty that they and the grantor
expected the charter powers to be exercised "here in England" (No. 54
below).</p>

<p>(2) The official records of the Company, <i>made at the time</i>, declare
explicitly that Governor Cradock's proposal to transfer the charter to
America (five months after it was granted) was "conceived by himself."
Further, <i>the general tenor</i> of those records for those five intervening
months agree wholly with the idea that the Company then had no thought
of leaving England (see some extracts, No. 57 below), and they contain,
in their fifty odd pages, no single suggestion of the other sort. Most conclusive
of all, the <i>Records</i> show that even after the surprised Company
had come to look with approval upon Cradock's proposal, they could not
easily adjust their plans and financial interests to the new movement.
(Advanced students will find the proof in the <i>Records</i>. It is impossible to
represent them here in the necessary complete detail to show this. It
may be added, however, that Cradock's proposal of July 28 was first
debated, then deferred a month for <i>secret</i> consideration; then debated,
in two meetings, by assigned sets of debaters for the two sides of the
argument; then legal advice was sought, with what result, we don't
know; and afterwards many plans were discussed as to how the transfer
<i>could</i> be made without "prejudicing" the interests of the majority of
the Company<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. See Nos. 57, 58, for some of the evidence.)</p>

<p>Of the 110 members of the Company in England, only about one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>fourth ever came to America. Cradock himself never came,&mdash;though he
had lands and servants here. Most of the members, who stayed in England,
lost all their investment eventually. Indeed, in the summer of
1629, the Company was already in serious financial straits. A special
inventory, in the fall, rated the stock at only one third the face value.
This condition may have inclined some stockholders to favor Cradock's
proposition in July. The funds paid in for stock by Winthrop and other
new members made it possible for old members to draw out (on this reduced
scale). In this sense, the new members "bought" out some of the
old ones.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;<i>No place of meeting</i> is suggested in the charter. This probably
resulted from the fact that the Company was made up partly of Londoners,
partly of Dorchester men (from the West of England; cf.
<i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 57). All such previous colonizing
corporations for America had been designated geographically (probably
for convenient descriptions, rather than for limitation). But the "Council
of Plymouth in the County of Devon" had never held a meeting at
Plymouth: its records show that all its meetings were held at London.
This fact may have helped to make the even more composite Massachusetts
Company wary about having a place of meeting mentioned in their
fundamental law. If John Winthrop is right in his statement of fifteen
years later (above) that such a limitation was at first put into this document
and that "with much difficulty we got it abscinded," then we may be
sure that the Company desired that elision, not in order that they might
hold meetings in America (as Winthrop afterward assumed), but to
prevent their being hampered in England. This view is made practically
certain when we observe the clause regarding place of meeting in the
charter of the Providence Isle Company (below). That company certainly
never expected to hold its meetings out of England, but it guards against
being hampered, not by mere silence, but by express provision that it
may meet where it likes.]</p></div>

<h4>55. Excursus: For a Comparative Study of Charters</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Notes upon the Charter for the Company of Westminster for the
              Plantation of the Island of Providence</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>December 4/14, 1630</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This very important charter has never been printed. An abstract in the
<i>Colonial State Papers</i> seemed so significant that the editor of this volume
secured a complete transcript of the charter from the manuscript in the
British Record Office. On that transcript, the notes below are based.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The colony of Providence Isle was of little weight, and the charter of
the proprietary Company, accordingly, has received scant attention. That
document, however, issued twenty-one months later than that of the
Massachusetts Bay Company, is in many ways the culmination of the
series of grants to English corporations for colonizing purposes. All the
powers granted to proprietaries in earlier charters, including those which
were dropped out in the Massachusetts charter, reappear here; and in
some important matters there is much new detail. A study of this document
removes the last possible basis for the claims of the older New
England historians that the Massachusetts charter was in any peculiar
way adapted to the purpose of a transfer to America.</p>

<p>1. <i>Puritan membership.</i>&mdash;The incorporators comprise the Earl of
Warwick, Lord Say and Sele, Sir Nathaniel Rich, Oliver St. Johns, and
John Pym,&mdash;all prominent leaders of the Puritan party, more prominent
than any Puritans in the Massachusetts Company.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sectarianism.</i>&mdash;The Company is given the "Patronages and Advowsons"
of "all" churches and chapells,&mdash;without even a restriction
as to the customs of the Church of England (such as is found in the
Baltimore charter). If this provision had been in the Massachusetts
charter, Puritan historians would have found it certain proof of an intention
to build a non-conformist state. The passage conferring authority
to impose the oath of supremacy is copied from the charters of 1612 and
1629. No other sectarian restriction occurs.</p>

<p>3. <i>Place of meeting.</i>&mdash;The Company are to govern themselves and
their settlement (as the Virginia Company of 1612 and the Massachusetts
Bay Company) in four "General Courts" each year; but these courts are
to be held "<i>in any place or places by themselves to be appointed</i>." (And,
again, the Company is authorized to hold its courts "<i>in any place or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
places convenient</i>"). Surely, this disposes of the ancient argument that
the omission of a specific place of meeting in the Massachusetts charter
suggests an intention to establish some place out of England.</p>

<p>The facts as to a specific meeting place for a colonizing corporation in
England seem to be as follows:</p>


<p><i>a.</i> The charter of 1606 establishes two sub-companies, which necessarily
are designated geographically to distinguish one from the other;
and the charters of 1609, 1612, and 1620 use geographical designations,
necessarily, to show to which one of those sub-companies they respectively
apply.</p>


<p><i>b.</i> But the "Plymouth Council" (charter of 1620) did not regard its
geographical designation as fixing its place of meeting, or else it found
it necessary to ignore the restriction. All its meetings were held, not at
Plymouth, but in London.</p>


<p><i>c.</i> The Massachusetts Bay Company was made up of two bodies of
men, one from the east, one from the west of England. This fact, together
with the experience of the Plymouth Council, probably made
them unwilling to have a place of meeting fixed in their charter.</p>


<p><i>d.</i> The Providence Isle charter carries this development, as suggested
above, to its logical conclusion, permitting the Company itself to fix the
places for its meetings. But this last Company certainly never expected
to leave England. So the old argument from the omission of a specific
place in the charter of the Massachusetts Company falls to the ground.</p>

<p>4. <i>Law making.</i>&mdash;In the General Courts the Company is empowered
"to ordaine frames of Government, <i>with all things thereto incident</i>;
and to make reasonable lawes ... not being contrarie to the Lawes of
this our Realme of England ... for the Government of the Company
... and of all Collonyes which shall be planted ... in the said
Islands ... and to appoint, by such title as they ... shall thinke good,
such ... offices and officers ... for such Times and with such powers,
as they shall thinke good, both for the Company here within our Realme
of England and for the Collonies in the said Islands ... and the said
Offices and Officers ... to alter ... and displace, and in their places, to
appoint others ... and the said Lawes ... to put into execution."...</p>

<p>5. Admiralty jurisdiction conferred.</p>

<p>6. Local Government. Power to divide the territory into "Provinces,
Counties ... Hundreds, Mannors," or other units, and to erect and
fortify villages, etc., and <i>to grant letters of incorporation</i> to towns and
burroughs, "with all Liberties and things unto Corporations requisite and
usual within this our Realme of England"; and to set up markets;
and to constitute and appoint magistrates and all manner of officers for all
local units, with fit legislation for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Power of punishment to extend to "life and members," with
authority to exercise martial law.</p>

<p>8. Right to settle restricted to those having a license from the
Company.</p>

<p>9. Rights of Englishmen guaranteed to settlers and their posterity.</p>

<p>10. Company to coin money (not gold or silver).</p>

<p>11. Repetition of the usual privileges granted in earlier charters, and
a "blanket clause" promising the Company "all such Prerogatives," etc.,
as have ever been granted to any colonizing Company in England.</p></div>

80), after explaining how the new Company came to ask for a grant from the
New England Council, adds: "to which it pleased the thrice honored Lord of

other weighty reasons therein contained, to transferr the
government of the plantacion to those that shall inhabite

upon; but those present are desired privately and seriously to
consider hereof, and to sett down their particular reasons in
wryting, pro and contra, and to produce the same at the next

so as no man of us would have adventured it without assurance

<p>Wherupon it was ordered, that this afternoone Mr. Wright,
Mr. Eaton, Mr. Adams, Mr. Spurstowe, and such others as they
should thinke fitt to call unto them, whether they were of the
Company or not, to consider of arguments against the setling
of the chiefe government in New England.</p>

<p>And, on the other syde, Sir Richard Saltonstall, Mr. Johnson,
Captain Venn, and such others as they should call unto them,
to prepare arguments for the setling of the said government
in New England; and that tomorrow morning, being the 29th

on both sydes; where were present many of the Assistants and

<p>As many of yow as desire to have the pattent and the government
of the plantacion to bee transferred to New England, <i>soe
as it may bee done legally</i>, hold up your hands: Soe many as
will not, hold upp your hands.</p>

<p>Where, by ereccion of hands, it appeared by the generall consent
of the Company, that the government and pattent should
bee setled in New England, and accordingly an order to bee
drawne upp.</p>

<h5><i>a. Winthrop's Argument for a Puritan Colony</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Robert Winthrop's <i>Life and Letters of John Winthrop</i>, I, 309 ff.</p>

<p>This argument is generally ascribed to John Winthrop, and one manuscript
of it at least is said to be in his handwriting. The first printed
copy was made by Hutchinson in his <i>Collections</i>, but from a different
manuscript.</p></div>

<p><i><b>Reasons</b> to be considered for justifieinge the undertakeres of the
intended Plantation in New England, and for incouraginge such
whose hartes God shall move to joyne with them in it.</i></p>

<p>1.&mdash;It will be a service to the Church of great consequence
to carry the Gospell into those parts of the world, to helpe on
the comminge of the fullnesse of the Gentiles, and to raise a
Bulworke against the Kingdome of Ante Christ which the
Jesuites labour to reare up in those parts.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;All other churches of Europe are brought to desolation,
and our sinnes, for which the Lord beginnes allreaddy to frowne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
upon us and to cutte us short, doe threatne evill times to be
comminge upon us, and whoe knowes but that God hath provided
this place to be a refuge for many whome he meanes
to save out of the generall callamity; and seeinge the Church
hath noe place lefte to flie into but the wildernesse, what better
worke can there be, then to goe and provide tabernacles and
foode for her against she comes thither:</p>

<p>3.&mdash;<i>This Land growes weary of her Inhabitants, soe as man,
whoe is the most pretious of all creatures, is here more vile and
base then the earth we treade upon, and of less prise among us
then an horse or a sheepe:</i> masters are forced by authority to
entertaine servants, parents to mainetaine there oune children,
all tounes complaine of the burthen of theire poore, though we
have taken up many unnessisarie yea unlawfull trades to mainetaine
them, and we use the authoritie of the Law to hinder the
increase of our people, as by urginge the Statute against Cottages,
and inmates; and thus it is come to passe, that children,
servants, and neighboures, especially if they be poore, are
compted the greatest burthens, which if thinges weare right
would be the cheifest earthly blessinges.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;The whole earth is the Lords garden and he hath given
it to the Sonnes of men with a general Commission: Gen:1:28:
"Increace and multiplie, and replenish the earth and subdue
it," which was againe renewed to Noah: the end is double
and naturall, that man might enjoy the fruits of the earth, and
God might have his due glory from the creature: why then
should we stand striving here for places of habitation, etc.
(many men spending as much labour and coste to recover or
keepe sometimes an acre or tuoe of Land, as would procure
them many and as good or better in another Countrie) and in the
meane time suffer a whole Continent as fruitfull and convenient
for the use of man to lie waste without any improvement?</p>

<p>5.&mdash;We are groune to that height of Intemperance in all
excesse of Riott, as noe mans estate allmost will suffice to keepe
saile with his aequalls: and he whoe failes herein, must live
in scorne and contempt. Hence it comes that all artes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Trades are carried in that deceiptfull and unrighteous course
as it is allmost impossible for a good and upright man to
mainetayne his charge and live comfortablie in any of them.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;The ffountaines of Learning and Religion are soe corrupted
as (besides the unsupportable charge of there education)
most children (even the best witts and of fairest hopes) are perverted,
corrupted, and utterlie overthroune by the multitude of
evill examples and the licentious government of those seminaries,
where men straine at knatts and swallowe camells, use all
severity for mainetaynance of cappes and other accomplyments,
but suffer all ruffianlike fashions and disorder in manners
[morals] to passe uncontrolled.</p>


<h5><i>b. Winthrop's Argument for Coming Himself to America</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>John Winthrop sent the following "Considerations" relating to himself
to various friends for their advice. <i>Life and Letters</i>, I, 327.</p></div>

<p>Particular Considerations in the case of J: W:</p>

<p>1: It is come to that issue as (in all probabilitye) the wellfare
of the Plantation dependes upon his goeinge, for divers
of the Chiefe Undertakers (upon whom the reste depende)
will not goe without him.</p>

<p>2: He acknowledges a satisfactorye callinge, outwarde from
those of the Plantation, inwardly by the inclination of his
oun hearte to the worke, and bothe approved by godly and
juditious Devines (whereof some have the first interest in
him), and there is in this the like mediate call from the Kinge,
which was to his former imployment.</p>

<p>3: Though his means be sufficient for a comfortable subsistence
in a private condition heere, yet the one halfe of them
being disposed to his 3: elder sonnes, who are now of age,
he cannot live in the same place and callinge with that which
remains; his charge being still as great as before, when his
means were double: and so if he should refuse this opportunitye,
that talent which God hath bestowed upon him for
publike service, were like to be buried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>4: His wife and suche of his children, as are come to years
of discreation, are voluntarylye disposed to the same Course.</p>

<p>5: Most of his friends (upon the former considerations)
doe consent to his change.</p>

<p>Winthrop's <i>Life and Letters of John Winthrop</i>, I, 306-307.</p></div>

<p>Sir,&mdash;My humble duty remembered to you and my
mother....</p>

<p>For the business of New England, I can say no other thing
but that I believe confidently, that the whole disposition
thereof is of the Lord, who disposeth all alterations, by his
blessed will, to his own glory and the good of his; and,
therefore, do assure myself, that all things shall work together
for the best therein. And for myself, I have seen so much
of the vanity of the world, that I esteem no more of the
diversities of countries, than as so many inns, whereof the
traveller that hath lodged in the best, or in the worst, findeth
no difference, when he cometh to his journey's end; and I shall
call that my country, where I may most glorify God, and
enjoy the presence of my dearest friends. Therefore herein
I submit myself to God's will and yours, and, with your leave,
do dedicate myself (laying by all desire of other employments
whatsoever) to the service of God and the Company herein,
with the whole endeavors, both of body and mind.</p>

<p>The CONCLUSIONS, which you sent down, I showed to my
uncle and aunt, who liked them well. I think they are unanswerable;
and it cannot but be a prosperous action, which
is so well allowed by the judgments of God's prophets, undertaken
by so religious and wise worthies of Israel, and indented
to God's glory in so special a service.</p>

<p>... So, desiring your prayers and blessing, I commend you
to the Almighty's protection, and rest</p>

<h5><i>d. News from New England, 1629</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Higginson's <i>Relation</i> is the name under which his <i>New-England's
Plantation</i> is commonly quoted. Apparently he sent back the manuscript
in the early fall (September, presumably) of 1629, some four months
after his arrival. The little book was printed in London in 1630, but before
that time it (together with earlier letters) had had much influence in
leading to the main Puritan migration. The selections below are taken
from Young's <i>Chronicles of Massachusetts</i>, where the spelling is
modernized.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fertility of the soil is to be admired at, as appeareth in
the abundance of grass that groweth everywhere, both very
thick, very long, and very high in divers places. But it
groweth very wildly, with a great stalk, and a broad and
ranker blade, because it hath never been eaten with cattle,
nor mowed with a scythe, and seldom trampled on by foot.
It is scarce to be believed how our kine and goats, horses and
hogs do thrive and prosper here, and like well of this country.</p>

<p>In our Plantation we have already a quart of milk for a
penny. But the abundant increase of corn proves this country
to be a wonderment. Thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, are ordinary
here. Yea, Joseph's increase in Egypt is outstripped here
with us. Our planters hope to have more than a hundredfold
this year. And all this while I am within compass; what
will you say of two hundred fold, and upwards? It is almost
incredible what great gain some of our English planters have
had by our Indian corn. Credible persons have assured me,
and the party himself avouched the truth of it to me, that of
the setting of thirteen gallons of corn he hath had increase of
it fifty-two hogsheads, every hogshead holding seven bushels
of London measure, and every bushel was by him sold and
trusted to the Indians for so much beaver as was worth eighteen
shillings; and so of this thirteen gallons of corn, which was
worth six shillings eight pence, he made about 327 pounds of
it the year following, as by reckoning will appear; where you
may see how God blesseth husbandry in this land. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
not such great and plentiful ears of corn I suppose any where
else to be found but in this country, being also of variety of
colors, as red, blue, and yellow, etc.; and of one corn there
springeth four or five hundred. I have sent you many ears of
divers colors, that you might see the truth of it.</p>

<p>Little children here, by setting of corn, may earn much
more than their own maintenance.</p>

<p>The temper of the air of New-England is one special thing
that commends this place. Experience doth manifest that
there is hardly a more healthful place to be found in the
world that agreeth better with our English bodies. Many
that have been weak and sickly in Old England, by coming
hither have been thoroughly healed, and grown healthful and
strong. For here is an extraordinary clear and dry air; that
is of a most healing nature to all such as are of cold, melancholy,
phlegmatic, rheumatic temper of body ... and therefore
I think it is wise course for all cold complexions to come to
take physic in New-England; for a sup of New-England's air
is better than a whole draught of Old England's ale.</p>

the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Smith wrote at the home of a
brother of John Winthrop's first wife, and seems to have been well acquainted
with the Puritan leaders.</p></div>

it over-glad me to see Industry her selfe adventure now to make
use of my aged ende[a]vours, <i>not by such (I hope) as rumour
doth report, a many of discontented Brounists, Anabaptists,
Papists, Puritans, Separatists, and such factious Humorists: for
no such they will suffer among them, if knowne, as many of the

<p>These are three. The Magistrate, who is the guardian and
conservator of the laws: The Laws, according to which he
governs: The People, who are governed by the laws, and obey
the magistrate....</p></div>

<p>IV.&mdash;The Lord hath not only testified that the function of
magistrates has his approbation and acceptance, but hath
eminently commended it to us, by dignifying it with the most
honourable titles. ... This is just as if it had been affirmed,
that the authority possessed by kings and other governors over
all things upon earth is not a consequence of the perverseness
of men, but of the providence and holy ordinance of God....</p>

<p>VII.&mdash;Those who are not restrained by so many testimonies
of Scripture, but still dare to stigmatize this sacred ministry
[magistrates] as a thing incompatible with religion and Christian
piety, do they not offer an insult to God himself, who
cannot but be involved in the reproach cast upon his ministry?
And in fact they do not reject magistrates, but they reject God,
"that he should not reign over them."...</p>

<p>VIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">And</span> for private men, who have no authority to deliberate
on the regulation of any public affairs, it would surely be
a vain occupation to dispute which would be the best form of
government in the place where they live. ... Indeed if these
three forms of government, which are stated by philosophers
[Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy], be considered in
themselves, I shall by no means deny, that either aristocracy
or a mixture of aristocracy and democracy far excell all
others; and that indeed not of itself, but because it very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
rarely happens that kings regulate themselves so that their
will is never at variance with justice and rectitude; or in the
next place, that they are indued with such penetration and
prudence, as in all cases to discover what is best. The vice
or imperfection of men therefore renders it safer and more
tolerable for the government to be in the hands of many, that
they may afford each other mutual assistance and admonition,
and that if any one arrogate to himself more than is right,
the many may act as censors and masters to restrain his
ambition. ... But if those, to whom the will of God has assigned
another form of government, transfer this to themselves
so as to be tempted to desire a revolution, the very thought will
be not only foolish and useless, but altogether criminal....</p>

<p>XIV.&mdash;From the magistracy we next proceed to the laws,
which are the strong nerves of civil polity, or, according to
an appellation which Cicero has borrowed from Plato, the
souls of states, without which magistracy cannot subsist.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>XXII.&mdash;The first duty of subjects towards their magistrates
is to entertain the most honourable sentiments of their function,
which they know to be a jurisdiction delegated to them from
God, and on that account to esteem and reverence them as
<i>God's ministers and vicegerents</i>. For there are some persons
to be found, who shew themselves very obedient to their
magistrates, and have not the least wish that there were no
magistrates for them to obey, because they know them to be
so necessary to the public good; but who, nevertheless, consider
the magistrates themselves as no other than necessary
evils. But something more than this is required of us by
Peter, when he commands us to "honour the king;" and by
Solomon when he says, "Fear thou the Lord and the King:"
for Peter, under the term honour, comprehends a sincere and
candid esteem; and Solomon, by connecting the king with
the Lord, attributes to him a kind of sacred veneration and
dignity. ... The obedience which is rendered to princes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
magistrates is rendered to God, from whom they have received
their authority.</p>

<p>XXIII.&mdash;Hence follows another duty: that, with minds
disposed to honour and reverence magistrates, subjects approve
their obedience to them, in submitting to their edicts, in paying
taxes, in discharging public duties and bearing burdens which
relate to the common defence, and in fulfilling all their other
commands. ... For, as it is impossible to resist the magistrate
without, at the same time, resisting God himself, though an unarmed
magistrate may seem to be despised with impunity, yet
God is armed to inflict exemplary vengeance on the contempt
offered to himself. Under this obedience I also include the
moderation which private persons ought to prescribe to themselves
in relation to public affairs, that they do not, without
being called upon, intermeddle with affairs of state, or rashly
intrude themselves into the office of magistrates, or undertake
any thing of a public nature. If there be anything in the
public administration which requires to be corrected, let them
not raise any tumults, or take the business into their own
hands, which ought to be all bound in this respect, but let
them refer it to the cognizance of the magistrate, who is alone
authorized to regulate the concerns of the public.</p>

<p>XXV.&mdash;But, if we direct our attention to the word of God,
it will carry us much further; even to submit to the government,
not only of those princes who discharge their duty to
us with becoming integrity and fidelity, but of all who possess
the sovereignty, even though they perform none of the duties of
their function. For though the Lord testifies that the magistrate
is an eminent gift of his liberality to preserve the safety
of men, and prescribes to magistrates themselves the extent
of their duty; yet he, at the same time, declares, that whatever
be their characters, they have their government only from
him; that those who govern for the public good are true
specimens and mirrors of his beneficence; and that those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
rule in an unjust and tyrannical manner are raised up by him
to punish the iniquity of the people; that all equally possess
that sacred majesty which he hath invested with legitimate
authority....</p>

<p>XXIX.&mdash;But it will be said, that rulers owe mutual
duties to their subjects. That I have already confessed. But
he who infers from this that obedience ought to be rendered to
none but just rulers, is a very bad reasoner. For husbands owe
mutual duties to their wives, and parents to their children.
Now, if husbands and parents violate their obligations, if
parents conduct themselves with discouraging severity and
fastidious moroseness towards their children, whom they
are forbidden to provoke to wrath: if husbands despise and
vex their wives, whom they are commanded to love and to
spare as the weaker vessels; does it follow that children
should be less obedient to their parents; or wives to their
husbands? They are still subject, even to those who are
wicked and unkind....</p>

<p>XXXII.&mdash;But in the obedience which we have shewn to
be due to the authority of governors, it is always necessary
to make one exception, and that is entitled to our first attention,
that it do not seduce us from obedience to him, to whose
will the desires of all kings ought to be subject, to whose
decrees all their commands ought to yield, to whose majesty
all their scepters ought to submit....</p>

<p>John Winthrop, leader of the great Puritan migration of 1630, while
on board ship, began a "Journal," which gradually merged into a great
contemporary "History." The work was printed first in 1790. A better
edition appeared in 1853; and, that edition having long been "out of
print," the work was re&euml;dited by Dr. James K. Hosmer in 1907
("Original Narratives" Series). The spelling and punctuation have

<p>(1) [<i>The Voyage.</i>]</p>

<p>April 6, 1630. [Eight days on board; but still delayed at
Yarmouth in the English Channel]....</p>

<p>Our captain called over our landmen, and tried them at their
muskets, and such as were good shot among them were enrolled
to serve in the ship, if occasion should be.</p>

<p>The lady Arbella<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and the gentlewomen, and Mr. Johnson
and some others went on shore to refresh themselves....</p>

<p>Thursday, 8. ... The wind continued N. [blank] with fair
weather, and after noon it calmed, and we still saw those eight
ships to stand towards us; having more wind than we, they
came up apace, so as our captain and the masters of our consorts
were more occasioned to think they might be Dunkirkers,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
(for we were told at Yarmouth, that there were ten sail of
them waiting for us;) whereupon we all prepared to fight with
them, and took down some cabins which were in the way of
our ordnance, and out of every ship were thrown such bed
matters as were subject to take fire, and we heaved out our
long boats, and put up our waste cloths, and drew forth our
men, and armed them with muskets and other weapons, and
instruments for fireworks; and for an experiment our captain
shot a ball of wild-fire fastened to an arrow out of a cross-bow,
which burnt in the water a good time. The lady Arbella and
the other women and children were removed into the lower
deck, that they might be out of danger. All things being
thus fitted, we went to prayer upon the upper deck. It was
much to see how cheerful and comfortable all the company
appeared; not a woman or child that showed fear, though all
did apprehend the danger to have been great, if things had
proved as might well be expected, for there had been eight
against four, and the least of the enemy's ships were reported
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>to carry thirty brass pieces; but our trust was in the Lord of
Hosts; and the courage of our captain, and his care and diligence,
did much encourage us. [The fleet prove to be friends.]</p>

<p>Saturday, 10. ... This day two young men, falling at odds
and fighting, contrary to the orders which we<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> had published
and set up in the ship, were adjudged to walk upon the deck
till night with their hands bound behind them, which accordingly
was executed; and another man, for using contemptuous
speeches in our<a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> presence, was laid in bolts till he submitted
himself, and promised open confession of his offence.</p>

<p>Lord's day, [May] 2. The tempest continued all the day,
with the wind W. and by N., and the sea raged and tossed us
exceedingly; yet, through God's mercy, we were very comfortable,
and few or none sick, but had opportunity to keep
the Sabbath, and Mr. Phillips preached twice that day....</p>

<p>Friday, 21. ... A servant of one of our company had bargained
with a child to sell him a box worth 3 <i>d.</i> for three
biscuit a day all the voyage, and had received about forty ...
We caused his hands to be tied up to a bar, and hanged a
basket, with stones, about his neck, and so he stood for two
hours.</p>

<p>(2) [<i>Early Religious Practices.</i>]</p>

<p>July 27. We, of the congregation [at Boston] kept a fast,
and chose Mr. Wilson our teacher,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and Mr. Nowell an elder,
... We used imposition of hands, but with this protestation
by all, that it was only as a sign of election and confirmation,
not of any intent that Mr. Wilson should renounce his ministry
that he received in England.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>[1631. April 12.]</p>

<p>At a court holden at Boston, (upon information to the
governour that they of Salem had called Mr. Williams to the
office of a teacher), a letter was written from the court to Mr.
Endecott to this effect: That whereas Mr. Williams had refused
to join with the congregation at Boston, because they would
not make a public declaration of their repentance for having
communion with the churches of England while they lived
there; and, besides, had declared his opinion, that the magistrate
might not punish the breach of the Sabbath, nor any
other offence, as it was a breach of the first table; therefore,
they marvelled they would choose him without advising with
the council; and withal desiring him [Endicott] that they
would forbear to proceed till they had conferred about it....</p>

<p>My Dear Wife,&mdash;The blessing of God all-sufficient be
upon thee and all my dear ones with thee forever.</p>

<p>I praise the good Lord, though we see much mortality, sickness
and trouble, yet (such is his mercy) myself and children,
with most of my family, are yet living, and in health, and enjoy
prosperity enough, if the affliction of our brethren did not hold
under the comfort of it. The lady Arbella is dead, and good
Mr. Higginson, my servant, old Waters of Neyland, and many
others. Thus the Lord is pleased to humble us; yet he mixes
so many mercies with his corrections, as we are persuaded he
will not cast us off, but, in his due time, will do us good, according
to the measure of our afflictions. He stays but till he hath
purged our corruptions, and healed the hardness and error of our
hearts, and stripped us of our vain confidence in this arm of flesh,
that he may have us rely wholly upon himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>The French ship, so long expected, and given for lost, is now
come safe to us, about a fortnight since, having been twelve weeks
at sea; and yet her passengers (being but few) all safe and well
but one, and her goats but six living of eighteen. So as now
we are somewhat refreshed with such goods and provisions as
she brought, though much thereof hath received damage by
wet. I praise God, we have many occasions of comfort here,
and do hope, that our days of affliction will soon have an end,
and that the Lord will do us more good in the end than we
could have expected, that will abundantly recompense for all
the trouble we have endured. Yet we may not look for great
things here. It is enough that we shall have heaven, though
we should pass through hell to it. We here enjoy God and
Jesus Christ. Is not this enough? What would we have more?
I thank God, I like so well to be here, as I do not repent my
coming; and if I were to come again, I would not have altered
my course, though I had foreseen all these afflictions. I never
fared better in my life, never slept better, never had more content
of mind, which comes merely of the Lord's good hand; for
we have not the like means of these comforts here which we
had in England. But the Lord is all-sufficient, blessed be
his holy name. If he please, he can still uphold us in this
estate; but, if he shall see good to make us partakers with
others in more affliction, his will be done. He is our God, and
may dispose of us as he sees good.</p>

<p>I am sorry to part with thee so soon, seeing we meet so seldom,
and my much business hath made me too oft forget Mondays
and Fridays. I long for the time, when I may see thy
sweet face again, and the faces of my dear children. But I
must break off, and desire thee to commend me kindly to all
my good friends, and excuse my not writing at this time. If God
please once to settle me, I shall make amends. ... The
good Lord bless thee and all our children and family. So I
kiss my sweet wife and my dear children, and rest</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jo. Winthrop.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>I would have written to Maplestead, if I had time. Thou
must excuse me, and remember me kindly to them all.</p>

<p>This is the third letter I have written to thee from New England.</p>

<p>[November 29/December 9, 1630.]</p>

<p>... Thou shalt understand by this, how it is with us
since I wrote last, (for this is the third or fourth letter I have
written to thee since I came hither,) that thou mayest see the
goodness of the Lord towards me, that, when so many have
died and so many yet languish, myself and my children are yet
living and in health. Yet I have lost twelve of my family,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
viz. Waters and his wife, and two of his children: Mr. Gager and
his man: Smith of Buxall and his wife and two children: the
wife of Taylor of Haverill and their child: my son H. makes
the twelve. And, besides many other of less note, as Jeff. Ruggle
of Sudbury, and divers others of that town, (about twenty,)
the Lord hath stripped us of some principal persons, Mr. Johnson
and his lady, Mr. Rossiter, Mrs. Phillips, and others unknown
to thee. We conceive, that this disease grew from ill
diet at sea, and proved infectious. I write not this to discourage
thee but to warn thee and others to provide well for the sea, and,
by God's help, the passage will be safe and easy, how long
soever. Be careful (I entreat thee) to observe the directions in
my former letters; and I trust that that God, who hath so graciously
preserved and blessed us hitherto, will bring us to see the
faces of each other with abundance of joy. My dear wife, we
are here in a paradise. Though we have not beef and mutton
etc., yet (God be praised) we want them not; our Indian corn
answers for all. Yet here is fowl and fish in great plenty. I
will here break off, because I hope to receive letters from thee
soon, and to have opportunity of writing more largely. I will
say nothing of my love to thee, and of my longing desires
towards thee. Thou knowest my heart. Neither can I men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>tion
salutations to my good friends, other than in general. In
my next, I hope to supply all. Now the Lord, our good God,
be with thee and all my children and company with thee. Grace
and peace be with you all. So I kiss my sweet wife and all my
dear children, and bless you in the Lord. Farewell.</p>

<p>[A narrative of the beginnings of the colony, through the
sending of Higginson's company in the spring of 1629.]</p>

<p>Theis by their too large comendacions of the country ...
invited us soe strongly to goe on that Mr. Wenthropp of
Soffolke (who is well knowne in his owne country and well
approved heere for his pyety, liberality, wisdome, and gravity)
comeing into us, wee came to such resolution that in April,
1630, wee sett sail from Old England with 4 good shipps.
And in May following, 8 more followed, 2 haveing gone be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>fore
in February and March, and 2 more following in June
and August besides another set out by a private merchant.
Theis 17 Shipps arrived all safe ... but made a long, a
troublesome, and a costly voyage. ... Our four shipps which
set out in Aprill arrived here in June and July, wheere we
found the colony in a sadd and unexpected condicion; above
80 of them beeing dead the winter before and many of those
alive, weake and sicke; all the corne and bread amongst them
all hardly sufficient to feed them a fortnight, insoemuch that
the remainder of 180 servants wee had the 2 years before sent
over, comeing to us for victualls to sustaine them, wee found
ourselves wholly unable to feed them ... whereupon necessity
enforced us, to our extreme loss, to give them all libertie, who
had cost us about 16 or 20 pounds a person furnishing and
sending over. But bearing theis things as we might, wee beganne
to consult of the place of our sitting downe: for Salem,
where wee landed, pleased us not. [They decide upon six new
settlements, besides the already established Salem and Charlestown.]
This dispersion troubled some of us; but helpe it wee
could not, wanting ability to remove to any place fit to build a
towne upon, and the time too short to deliberate longer, least
the winter should surprise us before we had builded our
houses. ... So, ceasing to consult further for that time, they
who had health to labour fell to building, wherein many were
interrupted with sicknes, and many dyed weekely, yea almost
dayley. ... Insomuch that the shipps being now uppon
their returne ... there was, as I take it, not much less than
an hundred (some think many more) partly out of dislike of
our government which restrained and punished their excesses,
and partly through fear of famine (not seeinge other means
than by their labour to feed themselves), which returned back
againe. And glad were wee so to bee ridd of them. Others
also, afterwards hearing of men of their owne disposition
which were planted at Piscataway, went from us to them;
whereby though our numbers were lessened, yet wee accounted
ourselves nothing weakened by their removall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the departure of the shipps, wee contracted with
Mr. Peirce, Mr. [Master] of the Lyon ... to returne to us
with speed with fresh supplies of victualls....</p>

<p>The shipps beeinge gone, victualls wastinge, and mortality
increasinge, wee held diverse fasts in our severall congregations,
but the Lord would not yet bee depricated [A long list
of deaths] And of the people who came over with us ...
[from Aprill to December] there dyed by estimacion about
200 at the least....</p>

<p>If any come hether to plant for worldly ends, that canne
live well at home, hee comits an errour of which hee will soon
repent him. But if for spirittuall, and that noe particular
obstacle hinder his removeall, he may finde here what may
well content him: viz., materialls to build, fewell to burn,
ground to plant, seas and rivers to ffish in, a pure ayer to
breath in, good water to drinke till wine or beare canne be
made,&mdash;which, toegether with the cowes, hoggs, and goates
brought hether allready, may suffice for food; for as for foule
and venison, they are dainties here as well as in England.
Ffor cloaths and beddinge they must bringe them with them,
till time and industry produce them here. In a word, wee
yett enjoy little to bee envyed, but endure much to bee pytyed
in the sicknes and mortalitye of our people. And I do the
more willingly use this open and plaine dealinge, least other
men should fall short of their expectations when they come
hether, as wee to our great prejudice did, by means of letters
sent us from hence into England, wherein honest men, out of
a desire to draw over others to them, wrote somewhat hyperbolically
of many things here. If any godly men out of religious
ends will come over to helpe us ... I thinke they cannot
dispose of themselves or their estates more to Gods glory
... but they must not bee of the poorer sort yett for diverse
yeares. Ffor we have found by experience that they have
hindered, not furthered the worke. And for profaine and
deboshed persons, their oversight in comeinge hether is
wondered at, where they shall finde nothing to content them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
If there bee any endued with grace and furnished with meanes
to feed themselves and theirs for 18 months, and to build and
plant,&mdash;lett them come into our Macedonia to helpe us.</p>

<p>[Record of disasters; the return of the Lyon] ... Also, to
increase the heape of our sorrous, wee received advertisement
by letters from our friends in England and by the reports of
those who came hether in this shipp to abide with us ...
that those who went discontentedly from us last yeare, out of
their evill affections towards us, have raised many false and
scandelous reports against us, affirminge us to be Brounists in
religion and ill affected to our state at home, and that theis
vile reports have wonne creditt with some who formerly wished
us well. But wee doe desire, and cannot but hope, that wise
and impartiall men will at length consider that such malcontents
have ever pursued this manner of casting dirt to make
others seeme as fowle as themselves, and that our godly
friends to whom wee have ben knowne will not easily believe
that wee are soe soon turned from the profession wee soe long
have made in our native Country. And for our further
clearing, I truely affirme that I know noe one person who
came over with us the last yeare to bee altered in his judgment
and affection eyther in ecclesiasticall or civill respects since
our comeinge hether; but wee doe continue to pray dayley for
our soveraigne lord the Kinge, the Queene, the Prince, the
royal blood, the counsaile, and the whole state, as dutye bindes
us to doe and reason persuades others to believe. For how
ungodly and unthankfull should wee be if wee should not
thus doe ... Lett our friends therefore give no creditt to
such malicious aspersions, but bee more ready to answer for
us than wee heare they have bene. Wee are not like those
which have dispensation to lye....</p>

generall vote of the people and ereccion of hands.</p>

<p>There were present, qualified to vote, the eight magistrates named
above, and certainly not more than one or two other "freemen,"&mdash;probably
<i>no one except the Assistants</i>. The "people" referred to in the
final sentence were probably the 109 men who came to this Court to ask
to be admitted "freemen." Apparently <i>they</i> were asked, in turn,
whether they would agree to this new law; and (not knowing the charter

admitted until May of the next year. Cf. <i>American History and

<p><i>A General Court, holden att Boston</i></p>

<p>For explanacion of an order made the last Generall Court ...
it was ordered nowe, with full consent of all the commons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>

the commons to propound any ... persons whom they shall
desire to be chosen Assistants [provision for voting on such
new nominations by "poll,"&mdash;vive-voce]. <i>The like course
[of voting] to be holden when they, the said commons, shall see
cause for any defect or misbehavior to remove any one or more

may be preserved of honest and good men, it was likewise

of some of the churches within the lymitts of the

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The italicized clause in the above entry is the one which indirectly
established a life-tenure for Assistants, contrary to the charter provision
for annual re&euml;lection of all such officers. The "commons" were to be
permitted to suggest and choose new Assistants (since the charter-number
of eighteen was far from full), <i>but, once elected, the Assistant held until
deposed for cause</i>.</p>

<p>At this same court, 116 freemen were elected, including those who
had so applied in the preceding October. Whether this admission was
before or after the legislation given above is wholly uncertain from the
<i>Records</i>; but the natural inference is that the applicants were asked to
assent to these changes also as a prerequisite to admission. After this
meeting, voters are always referred to as "freemen." The words
"people" and "commons" used in these records of October, 1630, and
May, 1631, refer, presumably, to people not yet admitted to the political
corporation.]</p></div>

<p>Winthrop's <i>History of New England</i> (under dates given).</p>

<p>Cf. introductory statements to No. 62 <i>a</i> above.</p>

<p>Winthrop's bias for aristocratic organization in politics and in industry
appears always in most na&iuml;ve unconsciousness;<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> but his fine candor and
magnanimity make his book as attractive as it is valuable.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>[November 23, 1631.] The congregation at Watertown
(whereof Mr. George Phillips was pastor) had chosen one
Richard Brown for their elder, before named, who, persisting
in his opinion of the truth of the Romish church, and maintaining
other errors withal, and being a man of a very violent
spirit, the court wrote a letter to the congregation, directed
to the pastor and brethren, to advise them to take into consideration,
whether Mr. Brown were fit to be continued their
elder or not; to which, after some weeks, they returned
answer to this effect: That if we would take the pains to
prove such things as were objected against him, they would
endeavour to redress them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The dissensions in the Watertown church soon led to a more active
interference by the government of the colony. The party of the elder
and pastor plainly resented this interference. There may be some connection
between that fact and the following famous "remonstrance"
in the matter of taxation.]</p></div>

<p>[1631/2. February 17.] The governour and assistants called
before them, at Boston, divers of Watertown; the pastor and
elder by letter, and the others by warrant. The occasion was,
for that a warrant being sent to Watertown for levying of &pound;8,
part of a rate of &pound;60, ordered for the fortifying of the new
town, the pastor and elder, etc., assembled the people and delivered
their opinions, that it was not safe to pay moneys after
that sort, for fear of bringing themselves and posterity into
bondage. Being come before the governour and council, after
much debate, they acknowledged their fault, confessing freely,
that they were in an error, and made a retractation and submission
under their hands, and were enjoined to read it in the
assembly the next Lord's day. The ground of their error was,
for that they took this government to be no other but as of a
mayor and aldermen, who have not power to make laws or raise
taxations without the people; but understanding that this
government was rather in the nature of a parliament, and that
no assistant could be chosen but by the freemen, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
power likewise to remove the assistants and put in others, and
therefore at every general court (which was to be held once
every year) they had free liberty to consider and propound
anything concerning the same, and to declare their grievances,
without being subject to question, or, etc., they were fully satisfied;
and so their submission was accepted, and their offence
pardoned.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Winthrop was overconfident. The Watertown men must soon have
recovered from the browbeating he had given them. May 1, Winthrop
called together the Assistants informally at his house, and warned them
"that he had heard the people intended at the next court to desire that
the Assistants might be chosen anew every year, and that the governor
might be chosen by the whole court, and not by the Assistants only. Upon
this, Mr. <i>Ludlow grew into a passion, and said that then we should have no
government, but there would be an interim wherein every man might do
what he pleased</i>." The others, however, did not anticipate quite such
deplorable results, and wisely concluded to submit. The results appear
in the following entry.]</p></div>

<p>[May 8, 1632.] A general court at Boston. Whereas it was
(at our first coming) agreed, that the freemen should choose
the assistants, and they the governour, the whole court agreed
now, that the governour and assistants should all be new chosen
every year by the general court, (the governour to be always
chosen out of the assistants;) and accordingly the old governour,
John Winthrop, was chosen; accordingly all the rest as
before, and Mr. Humfrey and Mr. Coddington also, because
they were daily expected....</p>

<p>... A proposition was made by the people that every company
of trained men might choose their own captain and officers;
but the governor giving them reasons to the contrary, they
were satisfied without it.</p>

<p>Every town chose two men to be at the next court, to advise
with the governour and assistants about the raising of a public
stock, so as what they should agree upon should bind all, etc.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The facts about this meeting of the General Court are given even
more briefly in the <i>Records</i>, but in agreement with these statements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Winthrop. The <i>Records</i> omit, naturally, all reference to the preceding
action at Watertown, which explains these reforms. The freemen had
now recovered the right to choose all magistrates annually, together with
some direct local control over taxation; but the lawmaking power was
still retained, unconstitutionally, by the Assistants.]</p></div>

<p>[The following entries from Winthrop's <i>History</i> show the desperate

<p>"August 6, 1633. Two men servants to one Moodye, of Roxbury, returning
in a boat from the windmill, struck upon the oyster bank. They
went out to gather oysters, and, not making fast their boat, when the
flood came, it floated away, and they were both drowned, although they
might have waded out on either side; but it was an evident judgment of
God upon them, for they were wicked persons. One of them, a little
before, being reproved for his lewdness, and put in mind of hell,
answered, that if hell were ten times hotter, he had rather be there
than he would serve his master, etc. The occasion was, because he had
bound himself for divers years, and saw that, if he had been at liberty,
he might have had greater wages, though otherwise his master used him
very well.</p>

<p>"November, 1633. ... The scarcity of workmen had caused them
to raise their wages to an excessive rate, so as a carpenter would have
three shillings the day, a laborer two shillings and sixpence, etc.; and
accordingly those who had commodities to sell advanced their prices
sometime double to that they cost in England, so as it grew to a general
complaint, which the court, taking knowledge of, as also of some further
evils, which were springing out of the excessive rate of wages, they made
an order, that carpenters, masons, etc., should take but two shillings the
day, and laborers but eighteen pence, and that no commodity should be
sold at above four pence in the shilling more than it cost for ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>

of bringing, etc.,) excepted. ..."</p>

<p>Winthrop, no doubt, put the cart before the horse. The increased
cost of all European goods, due to high freights, necessitated higher
wages; but Winthrop resents any attempt of the laborers to ask more
than their old European wages.]</p></div>

<p>For some three years after the great migration of 1630, the eight
Massachusetts "towns" were governed wholly by the central colonial

<p>[April 1, 1634.] ... Notice being sent out of the general
court to be held the 14th day of the third month, called May,
the freemen deputed two of each town to meet and consider of
such matters as they were to take order in at the same general
court; who, having met, desired a sight of the patent, and, conceiving
thereby that all their laws should be made at the
general court, repaired to the governour to advise with him
about it, and about the abrogating of some orders formerly
made, as for killing of swine in corn,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> etc. He told them,
that, when the patent was granted, the number of freemen was
supposed to be (as in like corporations) so few, as they might
well join in making laws; but now they were grown to so great
a body, as it was not possible for them to make or execute laws,
but they must choose others for that purpose: and that howsoever
it would be necessary hereafter to have a select company
to intend that work, yet for the present they were not furnished
with a sufficient number of men qualified for such a business;
neither could the commonwealth bear the loss of time of so
many as must intend it. Yet this they might do at present,
viz., they might, at the general court, make an order, that, once
in the year, a certain number should be appointed (upon sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>mons
from the governour) to revise all laws, etc., and to reform
what they found amiss therein; but not to make any new laws,
but prefer their grievances to the court of assistants; and that
no assessment should be laid upon the country without the
consent of such a committee, nor any lands disposed of....</p>

<p>[May 14.] At the general court, Mr. Cotton preached, and
delivered this doctrine, that a magistrate ought not to be turned
into the condition of a private man without just cause, and to
be publicly convict, no more than the magistrates may not turn
a private man out of his freehold, etc., without like public trial,
etc. This falling in question in the court, and the opinion of
the rest of the ministers being asked, it was referred to further
consideration.</p>

<p>The court chose a new governour, viz., Thomas Dudley,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Esq.,
the former deputy; and Mr. Ludlow was chosen deputy; and
John Haines, Esq., an assistant, and all the rest of the assistants
chosen again.</p>

<p>At this court it was ordered, that four general courts should
be kept every year, and that the whole body of the freemen
should be present only at the court of election of magistrates,
etc., and that, at the other three, every town should send
their deputies, who should assist in making laws, disposing
lands, etc. Many good orders were made by this court. It held
three days, and all things were carried very peaceably, notwithstanding
that some of the assistants were questioned by
the freemen for some errors in their government, and some fines
imposed, but remitted again before the court broke up. The
court was kept in the meeting house at Boston, and the new
governour and the assistants were together entertained at the
house of the old governour, as before.</p>

<h4>68. Reaction: The Aristocratic Veto</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Winthrop's <i>History of New England</i>.</p></div>

<p>[September 4, 1634.] The general court began at Newtown,
and continued a week, and then was adjourned fourteen days.
Many things were there agitated. ... But the main business,
which spent the most time, and caused the adjourning of the
court, was about the removal of Newtown [to Connecticut]....</p>

<p>Upon these and other arguments the court being divided, it
was put to vote; and, of the deputies, fifteen were for their
departure, and ten against it. The governour and two assistants
were for it, and the deputy and all the rest<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> of the assistants
were against it, (except the secretary, who gave no vote;)
whereupon no record was entered, because there were not six
assistants in the vote,<a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> as the patent requires. Upon this
grew a great difference between the governour and assistants,
and the deputies. They would not yield the assistants a
negative voice, and the others (considering how dangerous it
might be to the commonwealth, if they should not keep that
strength to balance the greater number of the deputies) thought
it safe to stand upon it. So, when they could proceed no
farther, the whole court agreed to keep a day of humiliation
to seek the Lord, which accordingly was done, in all the congregations,
the 18th day of this month; and the 24th the court
met again. Before they began, Mr. Cotton preached, (being
desired by all the court, upon Mr. Hooker's instant excuse of
his unfitness for that occasion). He took his text out of Hag.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>ii, 4, etc., out of which he laid down the nature or strength
(as he termed it) of the magistracy, ministry, and people,
viz.,&mdash;the strength of the magistracy to be their authority;
of the people, their liberty; and of the ministry, their purity;
and showed how all of these had a negative voice, etc., and
that yet the ultimate resolution, etc., ought to be in the whole
body of the people, etc., with answer to all objections, and a
declaration of the people's duty and right to maintain their
true liberties against any unjust violence, etc., which gave
great satisfaction to the company. And it pleased the Lord
so to assist him, and to bless his own ordinance, that the
affairs of the court went on cheerfully; and although all were
not satisfied about the negative voice to be left to the magistrates,
yet no man moved aught about it, and the congregation
of Newtown came and accepted of such enlargement as had
formerly been offered them by Boston and Watertown; and
so the fear of their removal to Connecticut was removed. ... At
this court were many laws made against tobacco, and immodest
fashions, and costly apparel,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> etc., as appears by the
Records: and &pound;600 raised towards fortifications and other
charges....</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Winthrop's <i>History of New England</i>.</p></div>

<p>March 4, 1634 [1635] ... At this court, one of the deputies
was questioned for denying the magistracy among us, affirming
that the power of the governour was but ministerial, etc. He
had also much opposed the magistrates, and slighted them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
and used many weak arguments against the negative voice, as
himself acknowledged upon record. He was adjudged by all
the court to be disabled for three years from bearing any
public office....</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This was Israel Stoughton, deputy from Dorchester (see No. 70, below).
Afterward Stoughton was an officer in Cromwell's original regiment of
Ironsides.</p>

this he was not called to account.]</p></div>

<p>[May 6/16, 1635.] A general court was held at Newtown,
where John Haynes, Esq., was chosen governour, Richard
Bellingham, Esq., deputy governour, and Mr. Hough and Mr.
Dummer chosen assistants to the former; and Mr. Ludlow,
the late deputy, left out of the magistracy. The reason was,
partly, because the people would exercise their absolute power,
etc., and partly upon some speeches of the deputy, who protested
against the election of the governour as void, for that
the deputies of the several towns had agreed upon the election
before they came, etc.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> But this was generally discussed, and
the election adjudged good.</p>

<p>Mr. Endecott was also left out, and called into question
about the defacing the cross in the ensign....</p>

<p>The governour and deputy were elected by papers, wherein
their names were written; but the assistants were chosen by
papers, without names, viz. the governour propounded one to
the people; then they all went out, and came in at one door,
and every man delivered a paper into a hat. Such as gave
their vote for the party named, gave in a paper with some
figures or scroll in it; others gave in a blank.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>
<p>A petition was preferred by many of Dorchester, etc., for
releasing the sentence against Mr. Stoughton the last general
court; but it was rejected, and the sentence affirmed by the
country to be just....</p>


<h4>71. Secret Ballot in a Local Election, because of Democratic and
Aristocratic Jealousies</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Winthrop's <i>History of New England</i>.</p>

<p>The use of the ballot noted in No. 70 was not the first in New England.
An earlier instance in the General Court of the year before has been
noted (No. 67 <i>a</i>, note), and the following extract shows an instance of its
use in a town election, along with other interesting political data. On
the matter of the ballot, cf. <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 77.</p></div>

<p>December 11, 1634. This day after the lecture,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> the inhabitants
of Boston met to choose seven men who should
divide the town lands among them. They chose <i>by papers</i>,
and, in their choice, left out Mr. Winthrop, Coddington, and
other of the chief men; only they chose one of the elders and
a deacon, and the rest of the inferior sort, and Mr. Winthrop
had the greater number before one of them by a voice or two.
This they did, as fearing that the richer men would give the
poorer sort no great proportions of land, but would rather
leave a great part at liberty for new comers and for common,
which Mr. Winthrop had oft persuaded them unto, as best
for the town, etc. Mr. Cotton and divers others were offended
at this choice, because they declined the magistrates; and Mr.
Winthrop refused to be one upon such an election as was
carried by a voice or two, telling them, that though, for his
part, he did not apprehend any personal injury, nor did doubt
of their good affection towards him, yet he was much grieved
that Boston should be the first who should shake off their
magistrates, especially Mr. Coddington, who had been always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
so forward for their enlargement; adding further reason of
declining this choice, to blot out so bad a precedent. Whereupon,
at the motion of Mr. Cotton, who showed them, that it
was the Lord's order among the Israelites to have all such
businesses committed to the elders, and that it had been nearer
the rule to have chosen some of each sort, etc., they all agreed
to go to a new election, which was referred to the next lecture
day.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Winthrop's <i>History of New England</i>.</p></div>

<p>May 17, 1637. Our court of elections was at Newtown.
So soon as the court was set, being about one of the clock, a
petition was preferred by those of Boston. The governour
would have read it, but the deputy said it was out of order;
it was a court for elections, and those must first be despatched,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>and then their petitions should be heard. Divers others also
opposed that course, as an ill precedent, etc.; and the petition,
being about pretence of liberty, etc., (though intended chiefly
for revoking the sentence given against Mr. Wheelwright,)
would have spent all the day in debate, etc.; but yet the
governour and those of that party would not proceed to election,
except the petition was read. Much time was already
spent about this debate, and the people crying out for election,
it was moved by the deputy, that the people should divide
themselves, and the greater number must carry it. And so it
was done, and the greater number by many were for election.
But the governour [Vane] and that side kept their place still,
and would not proceed. Whereupon the deputy [Winthrop]
told him, that, if he would not go to election, he and the rest
of that side would proceed. Upon that, he came from his
company, and they went to election; and Mr. Winthrop was
chosen governour, Mr. Dudley deputy, and Mr. Endecott of
the standing council; and Mr. Israel Stoughton and Mr.
Richard Saltonstall were called in to be assistants; and Mr.
Vane, Mr. Coddington, and Mr. Dummer, (being all of that
faction,) were left quite out.</p>

<p>There was great danger of a tumult that day; for those of
that side grew into fierce speeches, and some laid hands on
others; but seeing themselves too weak, they grew quiet.
They expected a great advantage that day, because the remote
towns were allowed to come in by proxy; but it fell out, that
there were enough beside. But if it had been otherwise, they
must have put in their deputies, as other towns had done, for
all matters beside elections. Boston, having deferred to
choose deputies till the election was passed, went home that
night, and the next morning they sent Mr. Vane, the late
governour, and Mr. Coddington, and Mr. Hoffe, for their
deputies; <i>but the court, being grieved at it, found a means to
send them home again, for that two of the freemen of Boston<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
not notice of the election.</i> So they went all home, and the next
morning they returned the same gentleman again upon a new
choice; and the court <i>not finding how they might reject them</i>,
they were admitted....</p>

Lords, 1636</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thomas Hutchinson's <i>History of Massachusetts Bay</i> (1769), App. II.</p>

<p>In 1636, certain Puritan lords in England sent to John Cotton in Massachusetts
a series of conditions upon which they might come to live in
the colony. Cotton prepared the answers, with "such leading men as
[he] thought meete to consult."</p></div>

<p><i>CERTAIN Proposals made by LORD SAY, LORD
BROOKE, and other Persons of quality, as conditions of their
removing to NEW-ENGLAND, with the answers thereto.</i></p>

<p><i>Demand 1.</i> That the Commonwealth should consist of two
distinct ranks of men,&mdash;whereof the one should be (for them
<i>and their heirs</i>) gentlemen of the country; the other (for them
and their heirs) freeholders.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Two distinct ranks we willingly acknowledge, from
the light of nature and scripture; the one of them called Princes
or Nobles, or Elders (amongst whom <i>gentlemen</i> have their place);
the other, <i>the people</i>. Hereditary dignity or honours we willingly
allow to the former, unless by the scandalous and base
conversation of any of them, they become degenerate. Hereditary
liberty, or estate of freemen, we willingly allow to the
other, unless they also, by some unworthy and slavish carriage,
do disfranchize themselves.</p>

<p><i>Dem. 2.</i> That in these gentlemen and freeholders, assembled
together, the chief power of the Commonwealth shall be placed,
both for making and repealing laws.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> So it is with us.</p>

<p><i>Dem. 3. That each of these two ranks should, in all public assemblies,
have a negative voice, so as without a mutuall consent
nothing should be established.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> So it is agreed among us.</p>

<p><i>Dem. 4.</i> That the first rank (consisting of gentlemen) should
have power, for them and their heirs, to come to the parliaments
or public assemblies, and there to give their free votes <i>personally</i>;
the second rank (of freeholders) should have the same
power for them and their heirs of meeting and voting, <i>but by
their deputies</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> Thus far this demand is practiced among us. The
freemen meet and vote by their deputies; the other rank give
their votes personally, only with this difference, there be no
more of the gentlemen that give their votes personally but such
as are chosen to places of office, either governors, deputy governors,
councellors, or assistants. All gentlemen in England
have not that honour to meet and vote personally in parliament,
much less all their heirs. But of this more fully, in an answer
to the ninth and tenth demand.</p>

<p><i>Dem. 5. That for facilitating and dispatch of business, and
other reasons, the gentlemen and freeholders should sit and hold
their meetings in two distinct houses.</i></p>

<p><i>Ans. We willingly approve the motion, only as yet it is not so
practiced among us, but in time, the variety and discrepancy of
sundry occurrences will put them upon a necessity of sitting apart.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Dem. 8.</i> [<i>The governor to be chosen from "gentlemen."</i>]</p>

<p><i>Ans. We never practice otherwise, chusing the governor either
out of the assistants, which is our ordinary course, or out of approved
known gentlemen, as this year, Mr. Vane.</i></p>

<p><i>Dem. 9.</i> That for the present, the Right Honorable the Lord
Viscount Say and Seale, the Lord Brooke, who have already
been at great disbursements for the public works in New-England,
and such other gentlemen of approved sincerity and
worth, as they, before their personal remove, shall take into
their number, should be admitted for them and their heirs,
gentlemen of the country. But for the future, none shall be
admitted into this rank but by the consent of both houses.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> The great disbursements of these noble personages and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
worthy gentlemen we thankfully acknowledge, because the safety
and presence of our brethren at Connecticut is no small blessing
and comfort to us. But, though that charge had never been
disbursed, the worth of the honorable persons named is so well
known to all, and our need of such supports and guides is so
sensible to ourselves, that we do not doubt the country would
thankfully accept it, as a singular favor from God and from
them, if he should bow their hearts to come into this wilderness
and help us. As for accepting them and their heirs into the
number of gentlemen of the country, the custom of this country
is, and readily would be, to receive and acknowledge, not only
all such eminent persons as themselves and the gentleman they
speake of, but others of meaner estate, so be it is of some eminency,
to be for them and their heirs, gentlemen of the country.
Only, thus standeth our case. Though we receive them with
honor and allow them pre-eminence and accomodations according
to their condition, yet we do not, ordinarily, call them forth
to the power of election, or administration, of magistracy, until
they be received as members into some of our churches, a privelege,
which we doubt not religious gentlemen will willingly
desire (as David did in Psal. xxvii. 4) and christian churches
will as readily impart to such desirable persons. Hereditary
honors both nature and scripture doth acknowledge (Eccles. x.
17.) but hereditary authority and power standeth only by the
civil laws of some commonwealths, and yet even amongst them,
the authority and power of the father is nowhere communicated,
together with his honors, unto all his posterity. Where God
blesseth any branch of any noble or generous family, with a
spirit and gifts fit for government, it would be a taking of
God's name in vain to put such a talent under a bushel, and a
sin against the honor of magistracy to neglect such in our
public elections. But if God should not delight to furnish
some of their posterity with gifts fit for magistracy, we would
expose them rather to reproach and prejudice, and the commonwealth
with them, than exalt them to honor, if we should call
them forth, when God doth not, to public authority....</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[In Cotton's personal letter to Lord Say and Sele and Lord Brooke
(Hutchinson's <i>Massachusetts Bay</i> (1765), App. III), a fuller statement as
to some features of Massachusetts practice and theory is given. The
English lords evidently objected to the restriction of citizenship to church
members. They wanted less of theocracy and more of aristocracy. Cotton
defends the middle course of the colony as follows:</p>

<p>... "Your Lordships advertisement touching the civill state of this
colony, as they doe breath forth your singular wisdome, and faithfulness,
and tender care of the peace, so wee have noe reason to misinterprite,
or undervalue your Lordships eyther directions or intentions therein.
I know noe man under heaven (I speake in Gods feare without flattery)
whose counsell I should rather depend upon, for the wise administration
of a civill state according to God, than upon your Lordship, and such
confidence have I (not in you) but in the Lords presence in Christ with
you, that I should never feare to betrust a greater commonwealth than this
(as much as in us lyeth) under such a <i>perpetu&acirc; dictatur&acirc;</i> as your Lordship
should prescribe. For I nothing doubt, but that eyther your Lordship
would prescibe all things according to the rule, or be willing to examine
againe, and againe, all things according to it. ... It is very suitable to
Gods all-sufficient wisdome, and to the fulnes and perfection of Holy Scriptures,
not only to prescribe perfect rules for the right ordering of a private
mans soule to everlasting blessednes with himselfe, but also for the right
ordering of a mans family, yea, of the commonwealth too, so farre as both
of them are subordinate to spiritual ends, and yet avoide both the churches
usurpation upon civill jurisdictions ... and the commonwealths invasion
upon ecclesiasticall administrations ... Gods institutions (such as
the government of church and of commonwealth may be) may be close
and compact, and co&ouml;rdinate one with another, and yet not confounded.
God hath so framed the state of church government and ordinances, that
they may be compatible to any common-wealth, though never so much
disordered in his frame. But yet when a commonwealth hath liberty to
mould his owne frame ... I conceyve the scripture hath given full direction
for the right ordering of the same. ... Mr. Hooker doth often quote
a saying out of Mr. Cartwright (though I have not read it in him) that
noe man fashioneth his house to his hangings, but his hangings to his
house. It is better that the commonwealth be fashioned to the setting
forth of Gods house, which is his church: than to accommodate the
church frame to the civill state. Democracy, I do not conceyve that ever
God did ordeyne as a fitt government eyther for church or commonwealth.
If the people be governors, who shall be governed? As for monarchy,
and aristocracy, they are both of them clearely approoved, and directed in
scripture, yet so as referreth the soveraigntie to himselfe, and setteth up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Theocracy in both, as the best forme of government in the commonwealth
as well as in the church.</p>

<p>"The law, which your Lordship instanceth in [that none shall be chosen
to magistracy among us but a church member] was made and enacted
before I came into the country; but I have hitherto wanted sufficient
light to plead against it. ... Your Lordship's feare that this will bring
in papal excommunication, is just, and pious: but let your Lordship be
pleased againe to consider whether the consequence be necessary....</p>

<p>"When your Lordship doubteth that this corse will draw all things
under the determination of the church ... (seeing the church is to determine
who shall be members, and none but a member may have to doe
in the government of a commonwealth) be pleased (I pray you) to conceyve,
that magistrates are neyther chosen to office in the church. ...
Nor neede your Lordship feare (which yet I speake with submission to
your Lordships better judgment) that this corse will lay such a foundation,
as nothing but a mere democracy can be built upon it. Bodine confesseth,
that though it be <i>status popularis</i>, where a people choose their
owne governors, <b>yet the government is not a democracy, if it be administered,
not by the people, but by the governors</b>, whether one (for then
it is a monarchy, though elective) or by many, for then (as you know)
it is aristocracy. ... Mean while two of the principall of [the requirements
of the Lords], the generall cort hath already condescended unto.
1. In establishing a standing councell, who, during their lives, should
assist the governor in managing the chiefest affayres of this little state.
They have chosen, for the present, onely two (Mr. Winthrope and Mr.
Dudley) nor willing to choose more, till they see what further better
choyse the Lord will send over to them, that so they may keep an open
doore for such desireable gentlemen as your Lordship mentioneth. 2.
They have graunted the governor and assistants a negative voyce, and
reserved to the freemen the like liberty also." ...]</p></div>

<h4>76. Some Relations with England, 1638</h4>


<h5><i>a. Attack upon the Massachusetts Charter</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thomas Hutchinson's <i>Collection of Original Papers</i> (1769), 105-106.</p>

<p>This is the last of several demands for the return of the charter between
the years 1634 and 1638. Winthrop refers to it as "a very strict
order." For the reasons why the colony "thought it safe" to disregard
the order, and for the earlier history, cf. <i>American History and Government</i>,
&sect; 61.</p></div>

<p><i>A Coppie of a Letter sent by the appointment of the Lords of

<p>This day the Lords Commissioners for foreign Plantations,
taking into consideration that the petitions and complaints of
his Majestys subjects, planters and traders in New-England,
grow more frequent than heretofore for want of a settled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
orderly government in those parts, and calling to mind that
they had formerly given order about two or three years since
to Mr. Cradock a member of that plantation, to cause the
grant or letters patent of that plantation (alleadged by him to
be there remaining in the hands of Mr. Winthrop) to be sent
over hither, and that notwithstanding the same, the said
letters patent were not as yet brought over: And their Lordships
being now informed by Mr. Attorney General that a Quo
Warranto had been by him brought according to former order
against the said patent, and the same was proceeded to judgment
against so many as had appeared, and that they which
had not appeared, were outlawed.</p>

<p>Their lordships well approving of Mr. Attorney's care and
proceeding therein did now resolve and order, that Mr.
Meawtis, clerk of the council attendant upon the said commissioners
for foreign plantations, should in a letter from
himselfe to Mr. Winthrop inclose and convey this order unto
him. And their Lordships hereby in his Majestys name, and
according to his express will and pleasure, strictly require and
enjoine the said Winthrop or any other in whose power and
custody the said letters patent are, that they fail not to
transmit the said patent hither by the returne of the ship in
which the order is conveyed to them, it being resolved that in
case of any further neglect or contempt by them shewed
therein, their lordships will cause a strict course to be taken
against them, and will move his Majesty to reassume into his
hands the whole plantation.</p>

<p><i>An Addresse of the General Court<br />
To the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners for foreigne
Plantations</i> [<i>September 6/16, 1638</i>]</p>

<p>The humble Petition of the Inhabitants of the Massachusets
in New England, of the Generall Court there assembled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the 6th day of September, in the 14th yeare of the Reigne
of our Soveraigne Lord King CHARLES.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whereas it hath pleased your Lordships, by order of the
4th of April last, to require our patent to be sent unto you,
wee do hereby humbly and sincerely professe, that wee are
ready to yield all due obedience to our soveraigne Lord, the
King's majesty, and to your Lordships under him, and in this
minde wee left our native countrie, and according thereunto,
hath been our practice ever since, so as wee are much grieved,
that your Lordships should call in our patent, there being no
cause knowne to us, nor any delinquency or fault of ours
expressed in the order sent to us for that purpose, our government
being according to his Majestyes grant, and wee not
answerable for any defects in other plantations, etc.</p>

<p>This is what his Majesties subjects here doe believe and
professe, and thereupon wee are all humble suitors to your
Lordships, that you will be pleased to take into further consideration
our condition, and to affoord us the liberty of
subjects, that we may know what is layd to our charge; and
have leaive and time to answer for ourselves before we be
condemned as a people unworthy of his Majesties favour or
protection; as for the quo warranto mentioned in the said
order, wee doe assure your Lordships wee were never called
to answer to it, and if wee had, wee doubt not but wee have
a sufficient plea to put in.</p>

<p>It is not unknowne to your Lordships, that we came into
these remote parts with his Majesties licence and encouragement,
under his great seale of England, and in the confidence
wee had of that assurance, wee have transported our families
and estates, and here have wee built and planted, to the great
enlargement and securing of his Majesties dominions in these
parts, so as if our patent should now be taken from us, we
shall be looked on as runnigadoes and outlawed, and shall be
enforced, either to remove to some other place, or to returne
into our native country againe; either of which will put us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
to unsupportable extremities, and these evils (among others)
will necessarily follow: (1.) Many thousand souls will be
exposed to ruine, being layd open to the injuries of all men.
(2.) If wee be forced to desert this place, the rest of the
plantations (being too weake to subsist alone) will, for the
most part, dissolve and goe with us, and then will this whole
country fall into the hands of the French or Dutch, who
would speedily imbrace such an opportunity. (3.) If we
should loose all our labour and costs, and be deprived of those
liberties which his Majesty hath granted us, and nothing
layd to our charge, nor any fayling to be found in us in point
of allegiance (which all our countrymen doe take notice of
and will justify our faithfulness in this behalfe) it will discourage
all men heereafter from the like undertakings upon
confidence of his Majestyes royal grant. <i>Lastly, if our patent
be taken from us (whereby wee suppose wee may clayme interest
in his Majestyes favour and protection) the common people here
will conseive that his Majesty hath cast them off, and that, heereby,
they are freed from their allegiance and subjection, and, thereupon,
will be ready to confederate themselves under a new government, for
their necessary safety and subsistance, which will be of dangerous
example to other plantations, and perillous to ourselves of incurring
his Majestyes displeasure, which, wee would by all means avoyd.</i><a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Upon these considerations wee are bold to renew our humble
supplications to your Lordships, that wee may be suffered to
live here in this wilderness, and that this poore plantation,
which hath found more favour from God than many others,
may not finde lesse favour from your Lordships [so] that our
liberties should be restreyned, when others are enlarged, that
the doore should be kept shutt unto us, while it stands open
to all other plantations, that men of ability should be debarred
from us, while they give incouragement to other colonies.</p>

<h4>77. Democratic Discontent, 1639</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(Winthrop's Denial of the Right of Petition; Abolition of the Life
Council; Delay in the Written Code)</p>

<p>Winthrop's <i>History of New England</i>.</p></div>

<p>May 22, 1639. The court of elections was: at which time
there was a small eclipse of the sun. Mr. Winthrop was
chosen governour again, though some laboring had been, by
some of the elders and others, to have changed, not out of any
dislike of him (for they all loved and esteemed him), but out
of their fear lest it might make way for having a governour for
life, which some had propounded as most agreeable to God's
institution and the practice of all well-ordered states. But
neither the governour nor any other attempted the thing; though
some jealousies arose, which were increased by two occasions.
The first was, there being want of assistants, the governour
and other magistrates thought fit (in the warrant for the court)
to propound three, amongst which Mr. Downing, the governour's
brother-in-law, was one, which they conceived to be done
to strengthen his party, and therefore, though he were known
to be a very able man, etc., and one who had done many good
offices for the country for these ten years, yet the people would
not choose him. Another occasion of their jealousy was, the
court, finding the number of deputies to be much increased by
the addition of new plantations, thought fit, for the ease both
of the country and the court, to reduce all towns to two deputies.
This occasioned some to fear, that the magistrates intended
to make themselves stronger, and the deputies weaker,
and so, in time, to bring all power into the hands of the magistrates;
so as the people in some towns were much displeased
with their deputies for yielding to such an order. Whereupon,
at the next session, it was propounded to have the number of
deputies, restored; and allegations were made, that it was an
infringement of their liberty; so as, after much debate, and
such reasons given for diminishing the number of deputies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
and clearly proved that their liberty consisted not in the number,
but in the thing, divers of the deputies, who came with
intent to reverse the last order, were, by force of reason,
brought to uphold it; so that, when it was put to the vote, the
last order for two deputies only was confirmed. Yet, the next
day, a petition was brought to the court from the freemen of
Roxbury, to have the third deputy restored. Whereupon the
reasons of the court's proceedings were set down in writing,
and all objections answered, and sent to such towns as were
unsatisfied with this advice, that, if any could take away those
reasons, or bring us better for what they did desire, we should
be ready, at the next court, to repeal the said order.</p>

<p>The hands of some of the elders (learned and godly men)
were to this petition, though suddenly drawn in, and without
due consideration. For the lawfulness of it may well be questioned:
for when the people have chosen men to be their rulers,
and to make their laws, and bound themselves by oath to submit
thereto, now to combine together (a lesser part of them) in
a public petition to have any order repealed, which is not repugnant
to the law of God, savors of resisting an ordinance of
God; for the people, having deputed others, have no power
to make or alter laws, but are to be subject; and if any such
order seem unlawful or inconvenient, they were better prefer
some reasons, etc., to the court, with manifestation of their
desire to move them to a review, than peremptorily to petition
to have it repealed, which amounts to a plain reproof of those
whom God hath set over them, and putting dishonor upon
them, against the tenor of the fifth commandment.</p>

<p>There fell out at this court another occasion of increasing
the people's jealousy of their magistrates, viz.: One of the
elders, being present with those of his church, when they
were to prepare their votes for the election, declared his judgment,
that a governour ought to be for his life, alleging for his
authority the practice of all the best commonwealths in Europe,
and especially that of Israel by God's own ordinance. But
this was opposed by some other of the elders with much zeal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
and so notice was taken of it by the people, not as a matter of
dispute, but as if there had been some plot to put it in practice.</p>

<p>June 9, 1639 ... The people had long desired a body of
laws, and thought their condition very unsafe, while so much
power rested in the discretion of magistrates. Divers attempts
had been made at former courts, and the matter referred to some
of the magistrates and some of the elders; but still it came to
no effect; for, being committed to the care of many, whatsoever
was done by some, was still disliked or neglected by others.
... Two great reasons there were, which caused most of the
magistrates and some of the elders not to be very forward in
this matter. One was, want of sufficient experience of the
nature and disposition of the people, considered with the condition
of the country and other circumstances, which made them
conceive, that such laws would be fittest for us, which should
arise <i>pro re nata</i> upon occasions, etc., and so the laws of England
and other states grew (and therefore the fundamental
laws of England are called customs, consuetudines). 2. For
that it would professedly transgress the limits of our charter,
which provide, we shall make no laws repugnant to the laws
of England, and that we were assured we must do. But to
raise up laws by practice and custom had been no transgression;
as in our church discipline, and in matters of marriage, to make
a law, that marriages should not be solemnized by ministers,
is repugnant to the laws of England: but to bring it to a custom
by practice for the magistrates to perform it, is no law
made repugnant, etc. At length (to satisfy the people) it proceeded ...<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>November, 1639. Some of the freemen, without the consent
of the magistrates or governour, had chosen Mr. Nathaniel Ward
to preach at this court, pretending that it was a part of their liberty.
The governour (whose right indeed it is, for till the court
be assembled the freemen are but private persons) would not strive
about it, for though it did not belong to them, yet if they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
have it, there was reason to yield it to them. ... In his sermon
he delivered many useful things, but in a moral and political
discourse, grounding his propositions much upon the old Roman
and Grecian governments, which sure is an error, for if religion
and the word of God makes men wiser than their neighbors,
and these times have the advantage of all that have gone before
us in experience and observation, it is probable that by all
these helps, we may better frame rules of government for ourselves
than to receive others upon the bare authority of the
wisdom, justice, etc. of those heathen commonwealths. Among
other things, he advised the people to keep all their magistrates
in an equal rank, and not give more honor or power to one than
to another, which is easier to advise than to prove, seeing it is
against the practice of Israel (where some were rulers of thousands,
and some but of tens) and of all nations known or recorded.
Another advice he gave, that magistrates should not
give private advice, and take knowledge of any man's cause
before it came to public hearing. This was debated after in
the general court, where some of the deputies moved to have
it ordered. [Successfully resisted by the magistrates.]</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Wood's sermon shows that he regarded himself as put forward to champion
democratic doctrine: cf. Cotton's sermons for the magistrates, noted
in former entries. An entry of Winthrop's, dated May 10, 1643, shows a
continuance of this democratic purpose.</p>

<p>"Our court of elections was held, when Mr. Ezekiel Rogers, pastor of
the church in Rowley, preached. He was called to it by a company of
freemen, whereof the most were deputies chosen for the court. ... Mr.
Rogers, hearing that exception was taken to this call, as unwarrantable,
wrote to the governour for advice, etc., who returned him answer: That
he did account his calling not to be sufficient, yet the magistrates were
not minded to strive with the deputies about it, but seeing it was noised
in the country, and the people would expect him, and that he had advised
with the magistrates about it, he wished him to go on. In his sermon
he described how the man ought to be qualified whom they should choose
for their governour, yet dissuaded them earnestly from choosing the
same man twice together, and expressed his dislike of that with such
vehemency as gave offence. But when it came to trial, the former
governour, Mr. Winthrop, was chosen again."]</p></div>

<h4>79. A Puritan View of Trade</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Winthrop's <i>History of New England</i>.</p></div>

<p>November, 1639. At a general court holden at Boston, a
great complaint was made of the oppression used in the country
in sale of foreign commodities; and Mr. Robert Keaine, who
kept a shop in Boston, was notoriously above others observed
and complained of; and, being convented, he was charged with
many particulars; in some, for taking above sixpence in the
shilling profit; in some, eight pence; and, in some small
things, above two for one; and being hereof convict, (as appears
by the records,) he was fined &pound; 200, which came thus to
pass: The deputies considered, apart, of his fine, and set it at
&pound; 200; the magistrates agreed but to &pound; 100. So, the court
being, divided, at length it was agreed, that his fine should be
&pound; 200, but he should pay but &pound; 100, and the other should be
respited to the further consideration of the next general court.
By this means the magistrates and deputies were brought to
an accord, which otherwise had not been likely, and so much
trouble might have grown, and the offender escaped censure.
For the cry of the country was so great against oppression,...</p>

<p>And sure the course was very evil, especial circumstances
considered: 1. He being an ancient professor of the gospel:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
2. A man of eminent parts ... 4. Having come over for
consciences sake...</p>

<p>These things gave occasion to Mr. Cotton, in his public
exercise the next lecture day, to lay open the error of ...
false principles, and to give some rules of direction in the
case.</p>

<p>Some false principles were these:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That a man might sell as dear as he can, and buy as
cheap as he can.</p>

<p>2. If a man lose by casualty of sea, etc., in some of his
commodities, he may raise the price of the rest.</p>

<p>3. That he may sell as he bought, though he paid too dear,
etc., and though the commodity be fallen, etc.</p>

<p>4. That, as a man may take the advantage of his own skill
or ability, so he may of another's ignorance or necessity.</p>

<p>5. Where one gives time for payment, he is to take like
recompense of one as of another.</p>

<p>The rules for trading were these:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A man may not sell above the current price, i. e., such a
price as is usual in the time and place, and as another (who
knows the worth of the commodity) would give for it, if he
had occasion to use it...</p>

<p>2. When a man loseth in his commodity for want of skill,
... he must look at it as his own fault or cross, and therefore
must not lay it upon another.</p>

<p>3. Where a man loseth by casualty of sea, ... it is a loss
cast upon himself by providence, and he may not ease himself
of it by casting it upon another; for so a man should seem to
provide against all providences, that he should never lose; but
where there is a scarcity of the commodity, there men may
raise their price; for now it is a hand of God upon the commodity,
and not the person.</p>

<p>June 4, 1642. ... At the same general court there fell out
a great business upon a very small occasion. Anno 1636, there
was a stray sow in Boston, which was brought to Captain
Keayne: he had it cried divers times, and divers came to see
it, but none made claim to it for near a year. He kept it in
his yard with a sow of his own. Afterwards one Sherman's
wife, having lost such a sow, laid claim to it, but came not to
see it, till Captain Keayne had killed his own sow. After
being showed the stray sow, and finding it to have other
marks than she had claimed her sow by, she gave out that he
had killed her sow. The noise hereof being spread about the
town, the matter was brought before the elders of the church
as a case of offence; many witnesses were examined, and Captain
Keayne was cleared. [The case was then brought before
the county court],&mdash;when, upon a full hearing, Capt. Keayne
was again cleared, and the jury gave him &pound; 3 for his costs.
[Keayne then recovers &pound; 20 damages for slander.] Story
[friend of "Sherman's wife"<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>], upon this, searcheth town and
country to find matter against Captain Keayne ... and got
one of his witnesses to come into Salem court and to confess
there that he had foresworn himself [in the former trial]; and
upon this he petitions in Sherman's name to this <i>general court</i>
to have the cause heard again; which was granted, and the
best part of seven days were spent in examining witnesses
and debating of the [case]. And yet it was not determined;
for there being nine magistrates and thirty deputies, no sentence
could by law pass without the greater number of both,
which neither [side] had; for there were for the plaintiff two
magistrates and fifteen deputies, and for the defendant
[Keayne] seven magistrates and eight deputies....</p>

<p>There was great expectation in the country, by occasion of
Story's clamours against him, that the cause would have passed
against the captain, but falling out otherwise, gave occasion to
many to speak unreverently of the court, especially of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
magistrates, and the report went, that their negative voice had
hindered the course of justice, and that these magistrates must
be put out, that the power of the negative voice might be
taken away.</p>

<p>June 12, 1643. ... The sow business not being yet digested
in the country [even Bellingham, ex-governor, urging a new
trial without a negative voice for the magistrates,&mdash;Winthrop
gives over three pages here to a review of the controversy.
Then follows:]</p>

<p>The sow business had started another question about the
magistrates' negative vote in the general court. The deputies
generally were very earnest to have it taken away; whereupon
one of the magistrates [Winthrop?] wrote a small treatise,
wherein he laid down the original of it from the patent, and
the establishing of it by order of the general court in 1634, showing
thereby how it was fundamental to our government, which,
if it were taken away, would be a mere democracy. He showed
also the necessity and usefulness of it by many arguments
from scripture, reason, and common practice, etc. Yet this
would not satisfy, but the deputies and common people would
have it taken away; and yet it was apparent (as some of
the deputies themselves confessed) the more did not understand
it. An answer also was written (by one of the magistrates
as was conceived) to the said treatise, undertaking to
avoid all the arguments both from the patent and from the
order, etc. This the deputies made great use of in this court,
supposing they had now enough to carry the cause clearly with
them, so as they pressed earnestly to have it presently determined.
But the magistrates told them the matter was of great
concernment, even to the very frame of our government; it had
been established upon serious consultation and consent of all
the elders; it had been continued without any inconvenience
or apparent mischief these fourteen years; therefore it would
not be safe nor of good report to alter on such a sudden, and
without the advice of the elders: offering withal, that if upon
such advice and consideration it should appear to be inconven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>ient,
or not warranted by the patent and the said order, etc.,
they should be ready to join with them in taking it away. Upon
these propositions they were stilled, and so an order was drawn
up to this effect, that it was desired that every member of the
court would take advice, etc., and that it should be no offence
for any, either publicly or privately, to declare their opinion in
the case, so it were modestly, etc., and that the elders should be
desired to give their advice before the next meeting of this court.
It was the magistrates' only care to gain time, that so the people's
heat might be abated, for then they knew they would hear
reason, and that the advice of the elders might be interposed;...</p>

<p>... One of the elders [Winthrop himself] also wrote a
small treatise wherein he handled the question, laying down
the several forms of government, both simple and mixt,
and the true form of our government, <b>and the unavoidable
change into a democracy if the negative voice were taken
away</b>....</p>

<p>March, 1644. ... At the same court in the first month,
<b>upon the motion of the deputies</b>, it was ordered that the court
should be divided in their consultations, the magistrates by
themselves and the deputies by themselves. What the one
agreed upon, they should send to the other; and if both
agreed, then to pass, etc. This order determined the great
contention about the negative voice.</p>

<p><i>Upon a generall and lawfull warning of all the Inhabitants the
14th of the 1st moneth 1645 these rules and orders following
presented to the Towne Concerning the Schoole of Dorchester are
Confirmed by the major parte of the Inhabitants then present.</i></p>

<p>First, It is ordered that three able, and sufficient men of
the Plantation shalbe Chosen to bee wardens or overseers of
the Schoole above mentioned who shall have the Charge
oversight and ordering thereof and of all things Concerneing
the same in such manner as is hereafter expressed and shall
Continue in their office and place for Terme of their lives
respectively, unlesse by reason of any of them removing his
habitation out of the Towne, or for any other weightie reason
the Inhabitants shall see cause to Elect or Chuse others in
their roome in which cases and upon the death of any of the
sayd wardens the Inhabitants shall make a new Election
and choice of others.</p>

<p>And Mr. Haward, Deacon Wiswall, Mr. Atherton are elected
to bee the first wardens or overseers.</p>

<p>Secondly, the said Wardens shall have full power to dispose
of the Schoole stock....</p>

<p>Thirdly, the sayd Wardens shall take care, and doe there
utmost and best endeavor that the sayd Schoole may from
tyme to tyme bee supplied with an able and sufficient Schoolemaster
who nevertheless is not to be admitted into the place
of Schoolemaster without the Generall consent of the Inhabitants
or the major parte of them....</p>

<p>Fivethly, the sayd wardens shall from tyme to tyme see
that the Schoole howse bee kept in good, and sufficient repayre,
the Charge of which reparacion shalbe defrayed and
payd out of such rents, Issues and profitts of the Schoole
stock, if there be sufficient, or else of such rents as shall
arise and grow in time of the vacancy of the Schoolemaster&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>if
there bee any such and in defect of such vacancy the wardens
shall repayre to the 7 men of the Towne for the tyme
beeing who shall have power to taxe the Towne with such
somme, or sommes as shalbe requisite for the repayring of
the Schoole howse as aforesayd.</p>

<p>Sixthly, the sayd Wardens shall take Care that every yeere
at or before the end of the 9th moneth their bee brought to
the Schoolehowse 12 sufficient Cart, or wayne loads of wood
for fewell, to be for the use of the Schoole master and the
Schollers in winter the Cost and Chargs of which sayd wood
to bee borne by the Schollers for the tyme beeing who
shalbe taxed for the purpose at the discretion of the sayd
Wardens.</p>

<p>Lastly, the sayd Wardens shall take care that the Schoolemaster
for the tyme beeing doe faythfully performe his dutye
in his place, as schoolmasters ought to doe, as well in other
things as in these in which are hereafter expressed, viz.</p>

<p>First, that the Schoolemaster shall diligently attend his
Schoole and doe his utmost indeavor for Benefitting his
<i>Schollers</i> according to his best discretion without unnecessaryly
absenting himself to the prejudice of his schollers,
and hindering there learning.</p>

<p>2ly, that from the beginning of the first moneth [March] untill
the end of the 7th he shall every day begin to teach at seaven of
the Clock in the morning and dismisse his schollers at fyve
in the afternoone. And for the other five moneths that is
from the beginning of the 8th moneth untill the end of the
12th moneth he shall every day begin at 8th of the Clock in
the morning and [end] at 4 in the afternoone.</p>

<p>3ly, every day in the yeare the usual tyme of dismissing
at noone shall be at 11 and to beginn agayne at one except
that</p>

<p>4ly, every second day in the weeke he shall call his schollers
togeither betweene 12 and one of the Clock to examin
them what they have learned on the saboath day preceding
at which tyme also he shall take notice of any misdemeanor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
or disorder that any of his skollers shall have Committed
on the saboath to the end that at somme convenient tyme due
Admonition and Correction may bee admistred by him according
as the nature, and qualitie of the offence shall require
at which sayd examination any of the elders or other Inhabitants
that please may bee present to behold his religious care
herein and to give there Countenance, and approbation of the
same.</p>

<p>5ly, hee shall equally and impartially receive and instruct
such as shalbe sent and Comitted to him for that end whither
their parents bee poore or rich not refusing any who have
Right and Interest in the Schoole.</p>

<p>6ly, such as shalbe Comitted to him he shall diligently
instruct as they shalbe able to learne both in humane learning,
and good literature and likewise in poynt of good manners,
and dutifull behaviour towards all specially their superiors as
they shall have ocasion to bee in their presence whether by
meeting them in the streete or otherwise.</p>

<p>7ly, every 6 day of the weeke at 2 of the Clock in the afternoone
hee shall Chatechise his schollers in the principles of
Christian religion either in somme Chatechism which the Wardens
shall provide and present, or in defect thereof in some
other.</p>

<p>8ly, And because all mans indeavors without the blessing
of God must needs bee fruitlesse and unsucessfull theirfore It
is to be a cheif part of the schoolemasters religious care to
Commend his schollers and his labours amongst them unto
God by prayer, morning and evening, taking Care that his
schollers doe reverendly attend during the same.</p>

<p>9ly, And because the Rodd of Correction is an ordinance of
God necessary sometymes to bee dispenced unto Children but
such as may easily be abused by overmuch severity and rigour
on the one hand, or by overmuch indulgence and lenitye on the
other. It is therefere ordered and agreed that the schoolemaster
for the tyme beeing shall have full power to minister Correction
to all or any of his schollers without respect of persons accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>ing
as the nature and qualitie of the offence shall require, whereto
all his schollers must bee duely subject and no parent or other
of the Inhabitants shall hinder or goe about to hinder the
master therein. Neverthelesse if any parent or others shall
think their is just cause of Complaynt agaynst the master for
to much severity, such shall have liberty freindly and lovingly
to expostulate with the master about the same, and if they shall
not attayne to satisfaction the matter is then to bee referred to
the wardens who shall impartially judge betwixt the master
and such Complaynants. And if it shall appeare to them that
any parent shall make causelesse Complaynts agaynst the
master in this behalf and shall persist and Continue so doeing
in such case the wardens shall have power to discharge the
master of the care and Charge of the Children of such
parents....</p>

<p>And because it is difficult if not Impossible to give particular
rules that shall reach all cases which may fall out, therefore
for a Conclusion It is ordered, and agreed, in Generall, that
where particular rules are wanting there It shalbe a parte of the
office and dutye of the Wardens to order and dispose of all
things that Concerne the schoole, in such sort as in their wisedom
and discretion they shall Judge most Conducible for the
glory of God, and the trayning up of the Children of the Towne
in religion, learning and Civilitie, and these orders to be Continued

<p>This Court, taking into consideration the great neglect of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>many parents and masters in training up their children in learning
and Labor and other impl[o]yments which may be proffitable
to the common wealth, do hereupon order and decree, that in
every towne the chosen men appointed for managing the prudentiall
affayers of the same shall henceforth stand charged with the
care of the redresse of this evill (so as they shalbee sufficiently
punished by fines for the neglect thereof, upon presentment of
the grand jury or other information or complaint in any Court
...) And for this end they ... shall have power to take
account from time to time of all parents and masters, and of
their children, concerning their calling and impl[o]yment of
their children, especially of their ability to read and understand
the principles of religion and the capitall lawes of this country,
and to impose fines upon such as shall refuse to render such
accounts to them ... and they shall have power, with consent
of any Court ... to put forth [as] apprentices the children
of such as they shall [find] not to be able and fitt to imploy
and bring them up....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>[Connecticut copied this law in 1642, and New Haven in
1644. The Connecticut preamble, like the one above, emphasizes
the civic motive: "For as much as the good education
of children is of singular behoof and benefit to any commonwealth
... it is therefore ordered," etc. Connecticut,
too, was more specific as to the exact penalty for delinquent
parents,&mdash;providing fines for the first two offenses, but the
removal and apprenticing of the children for continued delinquency.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts law closed with a lengthy provision for
elementary industrial training, the select men to provide materials
and see that "children sett to keep cattle be set to some
other imployment withall, as spinning ... knitting, weaving
tape, etc."</p>

<p>Plainly, this law of 1642 <i>assumed</i> that each town had a
school. The next law (<i>b</i> below) expressly <i>provides</i> such
schools.]</p>

<p>It is therefore ordered ... that every towneship in this jurisdiction,

50 householders, shall then forthwith appoint one within their
towne to teach all such children as shall resort to him to write
and reade,&mdash;whose wages shall be paid either by the parents
or masters of such children, or by the inhabitants in generall,
by way of supply [tax], as the major part of those that order
the prudentialls of the towne shall appoint: provided, those
that send their children be not oppressed by paying much
more than they can have them taught for in other townes.
And it is further ordered, that where any towne shall increase
to the number of 100 families or househoulders, they shall set
up a grammer schoole, the mr. thereof being able to instruct

the country in costliness of apparel, and following new fashions, sent for the
elders of the churches, and conferred with them about it, and laid it upon
them, as belonging to them, to redress it, by urging it upon the consciences of
their people, which they promised to do. But little was done about it; <i>for

<p>As long as she was permitted to do so, Massachusetts secured religious
uniformity by expelling or persecuting intruders who dissented from the
established order. This was the practice and theory of all states in that
day except Holland. Some individuals had advanced further, however,
both in England and America (cf. <i>American History and Government</i>,
&sect; 84, close, for illustrations); and religious freedom was the fundamental
principle in the Rhode Island "experiment" (No. 90, below).</p>


<h4>84. Puritan Arguments for and against Persecution</h4>


<h5><i>a. The Simple Cobbler of Agawam, 1647</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nathaniel Ward, minister of Ipswich (Agawam), was one of the few
of the Massachusetts clergy with democratic leanings. He had been
helpful in drafting the democratic <i>Body of Liberties</i> (No. 78). But
like that other democratic minister, Thomas Hooker (No. 93), Ward was
a strict <i>theocrat</i>. His <i>Simple Cobbler of Aggawamm</i> was published in
London in 1647.</p></div>

<p>... <span class="smcap">First</span>, such as have given or taken any unfriendly
reports of us <i>New-English</i>, should doe well to recollect themselves.
Wee have beene reputed a Colluvies of wild Opinionists,
swarmed into a remote wildernes to find elbow-roome for
our phanatick Doctrines and practises: I trust our diligence
past, and constant sedulity against such persons and courses,
will plead better things for us. I dare take upon me, to bee
the Herauld of <i>New-England</i> so farre, as to proclaime to the
world, in the name of our Colony, that all Familists, Antinomians,
Anabaptists, and other Enthusiasts <i>shall have free
Liberty to keepe away from us</i>, and such as will come to be gone
as fast as they can, the sooner the better.</p>

<p>Secondly, I dare averre, that God doth no where in his word
tolerate Christian States to give Tolerations to such adversaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
of his Truth, if they have power in their hands to suppresse
them....</p>

<p>Not to tolerate things meerly indifferent to weak consciences,
argues a conscience too strong: pressed uniformity in these,
causes much disunity: <i>To tolerate more then indifferents</i>, is not
to deale indifferently with God: He that doth it, takes his
Scepter out of his hand, and bids him stand by....</p>

<p>Concerning Tolerations I may further assert.</p>

<p>That Persecution of true Religion, and Toleration of false,
are the <i>Jannes</i> and <i>Jambres</i> to the Kingdome of Christ,
<i>whereof the last is farre the worst</i>....</p>

<p><i>Frederick</i> Duke of <i>Saxon</i>, spake not one foote beyond the
mark when he said. He had rather the Earth should swallow
him up quick, then he should give a toleration to any opinion
against any truth of God.</p>

<p>He that is willing to tolerate any Religion, or discrepant way
of Religion, besides his own, unlesse it be in matters meerly
indifferent, either doubts of his own, or is not sincere in it.</p>

<p>He that is willing to tolerate any unsound Opinion, that his
own may also be tolerated, though never so sound, will for a
need hang Gods Bible at the Devills girdle.</p>

<p>Every Toleration of false Religions or Opinions hath as many
Errours and sins in it as all the false Religions and Opinions it
tolerats, and one sound one more.</p>

<p>That State that will give Liberty of Conscience in matters of
Religion, must give Liberty of Conscience and Conversation in
their Morall Laws, or else the Fiddle will be out of tune, and
some of the strings crack.</p>

<p>Experience will teach Churches and Christians, that <i>it is farre
better to live in a State united, though a little Corrupt, then in a
State, whereof some Part is incorrupt, and all the rest divided</i>.</p>

<p>... There is talk of an universall Toleration. I would talke
as loud as I could against it, did I know what more apt and
reasonable Sacrifice <i>England</i> could offer to God for his late
performing all his heavenly Truths then an universall Toleration
<i>of all hellish Errors</i>, or how they shall make an universall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Reformation, but by making <i>Christs Academy</i> the <i>Divills
University</i>, where any man may commence [graduate] Heretique
<i>per saltum</i>; where he that is <i>filius Diabolicus</i>, or <i>simpliciter
pessimus</i>, may have his grace to goe to Hell <i>cum Publico
Privilegio</i>; and carry as many after him, as he can....</p>

<p>It is said, Though a man have light enough himselfe to see
the Truth, yet if he hath not enough to enlighten others, he is
bound to tolerate them, I will engage my self, that all the
Devills in <i>Britanie</i> shall sell themselves to their shirts, to purchase
a Lease of this Position for three of their Lives, under
the Seale of the Parliament.</p>

<p>It is said, That Men ought to have Liberty of their Conscience,
and that it is persecution to debarre them of it: I can rather
stand amazed then reply to this: it is an astonishment to
think that the braines of men should be parboyl'd in such impious
ignorance; Let all the wits under the Heavens lay their
heads together and finde an Assertion worse then this (one
excepted) I will petition to be chosen the universall Ideot of
the world....</p>

<p>The true English of all this their false Latine is nothing but
<i>a generall Toleration of all Opinions</i>....</p>


<h5><i>b. From the Wonder-working Providence, of Sions Saviour
in New England (Book III, Chapter V)</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This quaint history was printed in London in 1654, anonymously.

the authorship to Captain Edward Johnson, one of the companions of
Winthrop in the migration of 1630.</p></div>

<p>... and in the year 1648 they [the laws] were printed,
and now are to be seen of all men, to the end that none may
plead ignorance, and that all who intend to transport themselves
hither, may know this is no place of licentious liberty,
nor will this people suffer any to trample down this Vineyard
of the Lord, but with diligent execution will cut off from the
city of the Lord the wicked doers, and if any man can shew
wherein any of them derogate from the Word of God, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
willingly will they accept thereof, and amend their imperfections
(the Lord assisting) but let not any ill-affected persons
find fault with them, because they suit not with their own
humour, or because they meddle with matters of Religion,
for it is no wrong to any man, that a people who have spent
their estates, many of them, and ventured their lives for to
keep faith and a pure conscience, to use all means that the
Word of God allows for maintenance and continuance of the
same, especially [when] they have taken up a desolate Wilderness
to be their habitation, and not deluded any by keeping their
profession in huggermug, but print and proclaim to all the way
and course they intend, God willing, to walk in; [and] if any
will yet notwithstanding seek to justle them out of their own
right, let them not wonder if they meet with all the opposition
a people put to their greatest straits can make; ... but ...
it seems unreasonable, and savours too much of hypocricie,
that any people should pray unto the Lord for the speedy
accomplishment of his Word in the overthrow of Antichrist,
and in the mean time become a Patron to sinful opinions and
damnable errors that oppose the truths of Christ....</p>


<h5><i>c. Discussion between Saltonstall and Cotton (about
1650)</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hutchinson's <i>Collection of Original Papers</i> (1769), 401-406.</p>

<p>Saltonstall was the chief founder of Watertown, and one of the signers
of the Cambridge Agreement (No. 58 <i>b</i>). Like his town, he was inclined
to democracy in politics and to "Separation" in religion. This letter
to the Boston pastors was written from England (to which he had returned
in 1631) about 1650. Both letters are without dates.</p></div>

<p>(1) <i>Sir Richard Saltonstall to Mr. Cotton and Mr. Wilson</i></p>

<p>Reverend and deare friends, whom I unfaynedly love and
respect:</p>

<p>It doth not a little grieve my spirit to heare what sadd
things are reported dayly of your tyranny and presecutions in
New-England,&mdash;<b><i>as that you fyne, whip, and imprison men for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
consciences</i></b>. First, you compell such to come into your assemblyes
as you know will not joyne with you in your worship, and
when they shew their dislike thereof or witnes against it,
then you styrre up your magistrates to punish them for such
(as you conceyve) their publicke affronts. Truely, friends,
this your practice of compelling any in matters of worship to
doe that whereof they are not fully persuaded, is to make
them sin; for soe the apostle (Rom. 14 and 23.) tells us; and
many are made hypocrites thereby, conforming in their outward
man for feare of punishment. We pray for you and wish you
prosperitie every way, [and] hoped the Lord would have given
you so much light and love there that you might have been
eyes to God's people here, and not to practice those courses in
a wildernes which you went so farre to prevent. These rigid
wayes have layed you very lowe in the hearts of the saynts.
I doe assure you I have heard them pray in the publique
assemblies that the Lord would give you meeke and humble
spirits, not to stryve soe much for uniformity as [instead] to
keepe the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.</p>

<p>When I was in Holland about the beginning of our warres,
I remember some christians there, that then had serious
thoughts of planting in New-England, desired me to write to
the governor thereof to know if those that differ from you
in opinion, yet houlding the same foundation in religion (as
Anabaptists, Seekers, Antinomians, and the like), might be
permitted to live among you; to which I received this short
answer from your then governour Mr. Dudley; <b><i>God forbid</i></b> (said
he) <b><i>our love for the truth should be growne soe could that we should
tolerate errours</i></b>: and when (for satisfaction of myself and others)
I desired to know your grounds, he referred me to the books
written here between the Presbyterians and Independents;&mdash;which
if that had been sufficient, I needed not have sent soe
farre to understand the reasons of your practice. I hope you
do not assume to yourselves infallibilitie of judgment, when
the most learned of the Apostles confesseth he knew but in
parte and sawe but darkely as through a glass; for God is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
light, and no further than he doth illuminate us can we see, be
our partes and learning never soe great. Oh that all those
who are brethren, though yet they cannot thinke and speake
the same things might be of one accord in the Lord. Now
the God of patience and consolation grant you to be thus
mynded towards one another, after the example of Jesus
Christ our blessed Savyor, in whose everlasting armes of protection
hee leaves you who will never leave to be</p>

<p class="center">Your truly and much affectionate<br />
friend in the nearest union,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ric. Saltonstall.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For my reverend and worthyly much esteemed friends Mr. Cotton and
Mr. Wilson, preachers to the church which is at Boston in New-England,
give this.</p></div>

<p class="center">(2) Mr. <i>Cotton's Answer to Sir Richard Saltonstall</i></p>

<p>... You thinke to compell all men in matter of worship is
to make men sinne (according to Rom. 14. 23.). If the worship
be lawfull in itselfe, the magistrate compelling him to come to
it compelleth him not to sinne, <i>but the sinne is in his will that
needs to be compelled to a christian duty</i>. Josiah compelled all
Israel, or (which is all one) made to serve the Lord their God,
2 Chron. 34. 33. yet his act herein was not blamed but recorded
amongst his virtuous actions. For a governour to suffer any
within his gates to prophane the sabbath, is a sinne against the
4th commandment, both in the private householder and in the
magistrate; and if he requires them to present themselves
before the Lord, the magistrate sinneth not, nor doth the
subject sinne so great a sinne as if he did refraine to come....</p>

<p>But (say you) it doth but make men hypocrites to compell
men to conforme the outward man for feare of punishment.
If it did so, yet better to be hypocrites than prophane persons.
Hypocrites give God part of his due, the outward man, but the
prophane person giveth God neither outward nor inward
man....</p>

<p>What you wrote out of Holland to our then governor Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Dudley, in behalfe of Anabaptists, Antinomians, Seekers, and
the like, it seemeth, mett with a short answer from him, but
zealous; for zeal will not beare such mixtures as coldnesse or
lukewarmenesse will, Revel. 2. 2. 14. 15. 20.</p>


<h4>85. Criticism by a Moderate Episcopalian and Monarchist</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lechford's "Plaine Dealing" (1641), reprinted in <i>Massachusetts Historical
Society Collections</i>, Third Series, III, 55 ff.</p>

<p>Thomas Lechford was in New England from 1637 to 1641. His point
of view is not seriously unfriendly.</p></div>

<p>... And I doe not this, God knoweth, as delighting to lay
open the infirmities of these well-affected men, many of them
my friends,&mdash;but that it is necessary, at this time, for the whole
Church of God, and themselves, as I take it. Besides, many of
the things are not infirmities, but such as I am bound to protest
against; yet I acknowledge there are some wise men among
them who would help to mend things, if they were able. ...
And I think that wiser men then they, going into a wildernesse
to set up another strange government differing from the settled
government here, might have falne into greater errors then
they have done.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>[After describing the method of organizing a church.] And
the generall Court will not allow of any Church otherwise
gathered.</p>

<p>Some Ministers have there heretofore, as I have heard, disclaimed
the power of their Ministry, received in England, but
others among them have not. Generally, for the most part,
they hold the Pastors and Teachers offices to be distinct; the
Teacher to minister a word of knowledg, the Pastor a word of
wisdome, but some hold them all one; as in the Church of Watertowne,
there are two Pastors, neither will that Church send
any messengers to any other Church-gathering or ordination.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>
<p>... Now <i>the most of the persons</i> at New-England are not
admitted of their Church, and therefore are not Freemen, and
when they come to be tryed there, be it for life or limb, name
or estate, or whatsoever, they must bee tryed and judged too
by those of the Church, who are in a sort their adversaries:
how equall that hath been or may be, some by experience doe
know, others may judge.</p>

<p>Profane swearing, drunkennesse, and beggers, are but rare
in the compasse of this Patent, through the circumspection of
the Magistrates, and the providence of God hitherto, the poore
there living by their labours and great wages, proportionably,
better then the rich by their stocks, which without exceeding
great care, quickly waste....</p>

<p>But the people begin to complain [that] they are ruled like
<i>slaves</i>, and in short time shall have their children for the most
part remain unbaptized: and so have little more privilege than
Heathens, unlesse the discipline be amended....</p>

<p><i>When I was to come away, one of the chiefest in the Country
wished me to deliver him a note of what things I misliked in the
Country, which I did, thus:</i></p>

<p>I doubt,</p>

<p>1. Whether so much time should be spent in the publique
Ordinances, on the Sabbath day, because that thereby some
necessary duties of the Sabbath must be needs be hindered,
as visitation of the sick, and poore, and family.</p>

<p>2. Whether matters of offence should be publiquely handled,
either before the whole Church, or strangers.</p>

<p>3. Whether so much time should be spent in particular
catechizing those that are admitted to the communion of the
Church, either men or women; or that they should make long
speeches; or when they come publiquely to be admitted, any
should speak contradictorily, or in recommendation of any,
unlesse before the Elders, upon just occasion.</p>

<p>4. Whether the censures of the Church should be ordered,
in publique, before all the Church, or strangers, other then the
denunciation of the censures, and pronunciation of the solutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Whether any of our Nation, that is not extremely ignorant
or scandalous, should bee kept from the Communion,
or his children from Baptisme....</p>

<p>10. That the civill government is not so equally administered,
nor can be, divers orders or bylaws considered.</p>

<p>11. That unlesse these things be wisely and in time prevented,
many of your usefullest men will remove and scatter
from you.</p>

<p><i>Certain Quaeres about Church government, planting Churches,
and some other Experiments.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>32. Whether or no to maintain a desired purity or perfection
in the Magistracie, by election of the people, these good
men of New-England, are not forced to be too strict in receiving
the brethren, and to run a course tending to heathenisme?</p>

<p>33. Whether have not <i>popular elections</i> of chiefe Magistrates
beene, and are they not, very dangerous to States and
Kingdomes? Are there not some great mysteries of State
and government? Is it possible, convenient, or necessary, for
all men to attain to the knowledge of those mysteries, or to
have the like measure of knowledge, faith, mercifulnesse, wisdome,
courage, magnanimity, patience? Whence are Kings
denominated, but from their skill and knowledge to rule?
whereto they are even born and educated, and by long experience,
and faithfull Counsellors enabled, and the grace and
blessing of God upon all? Doe not the wise, good, ancient,
and renowned Laws of England attribute much, yea, very
much trust and confidence to the King, as to the head and
supreame Governour, though much be also in the rest of the
great body, heart and hands, and feete, to counsell, maintain,
and preserve the whole, but especially the Head?</p>

<p>34. Hence what government for an Englishman but an hereditary,
successive, King, the son of Nobles, well counselled
and assisted?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I thank God, now I understand by experience, that there is
no such government for Englishmen, or any Nation, as a
Monarchy; nor for Christians, as by a lawfull Ministrie, under
godly Diocesan Bishops....</p>

of illegall committments, unjust imprisonments, taxes, rates,
customes, levyes of ungrounded and undoing assessments,
unjustifiable presses, undue fynes, unmeasurable expences and
charges, of unconceyvable dangers through a negative or
destructive vote unduly placed, and not well regulated,&mdash;in a
word, of a non-certainty of all things we enjoy, whether lives,
liberties, or estate; and also of undue oaths, being subject to
exposition, according to the will of him or them that gives
them, and not according to a due and unbowed rule of law....</p>

<p>Wherefore our humble desire and request is, that you would
be pleased to consider of our present condition and upon what
foundation we stand, and unanimously concurr to establish the
fundamentall and wholesome lawes of our native country, and
such others as are no wayes repugnant to them, unto which all
of us are most accustomed; and we suppose them best agreeable
to our English tempers, and yourselves obliged thereunto
by the generall charter and your oathes of allegiance....</p>

<p>2. <i>Whereas there are many thousands in these plantations, of
the English nation, freeborne, quiett and peaceable men, righteous
in their dealings, forward with hand, heart and purse, to advance
the publick good, knowne friends to the honorable and victorious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>Houses of Parliament, lovers of their nation, etc. who are debarred
from all civill imployments</i> (without any just cause that we
know) not being permitted to bear the least office (though it
cannot be denied but some are well qualifyed) no not so much
as to have any vote in choosing magistrates, captains or other
civill and military officers; notwithstanding they have here
expended their youth, borne the burthen of the day, wasted
much of their estates for the subsistence of these poore
plantations, paid all assessments, taxes, rates, at least equall,
if not exceeding others, yea when the late warre was denounced
against the Narrowganset Indians, without their consent, their
goods were seized on for the service, themselves and servants
especially forced and impressed to serve in that warre, to the
hazarding of all things most dear and near unto them, whence
issue forth many great inconveniences, secret discontents,
murmurings, rents in the plantations, discouragements in
their callings, unsettlednes in their minds, strife, contention,
and the Lord only knows to what a flame in time it may
kindle; also jealousies of too much unwarranted power and
dominion on the one side, and of perpetual slavry and bondage
on the other, and, which is intollerable, even by those who
ought to love and respect them as brethren.</p>

<p><i>We therefore desire that civill liberty and freedom be forthwith
granted to all truely English, equall to the rest of their countrymen,
as in all plantations is accustomed to be done, and us all freeborne
enjoy in our native country</i> (we hoping here in some things to
enjoy greater liberties than elsewhere, counting it no small losse
of liberty to be as it were banished from our native home, and
enforced to lay our bones in a strange wildernes) without imposing
any oathes or covenant on them, ... Further, that
none of the English nation, who at this time are too forward to
be gone, and very backward to come hither, be banished, unles
they break the known lawes of England in so high a measure,
as to deserve so high a punishment; and that those few that
come over may settle here without having two magistrates
hands, which sometimes not being possible to obtain, hath pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>cured
a kind of banishment to some, who might have been serviceable
to this place, as they have been to the state of England,
etc. And we likewise desire that no greater punishments be
inflicted upon offenders than are allowed and sett by the laws
of our native country.</p>

<p>3. Whereas there are diverse sober, righteous and godly men,
eminent for knowledge and other gracious gifts of the holy
spirit, no wayes scandalous in their lives and conversation, members
of the church of England (in all ages famous for piety and
learning) not dissenting from the latest and best reformation
of England, Scotland, etc. yet they and their posterity are deteined
from the seales of the covenant of free grace, because,
as it is supposed, they will not take these churches covenants,
for which as yet they see no light in Gods word; neither can
they clearly perceive what they are, every church having their
covenant differing from anothers, at least in words....</p>

<p>We therefore humbly intreat you, in whose hands it is to
help and whose judicious eyes discern these great inconveniences,
for the glory of God and the comfort of your brethren
and countrymen, to give liberty to the members of the church
of England, not scandalous in their lives and conversations
(as members of these churches) to be taken into your congregation
and to enjoy with you all those liberties and ordinances
Christ hath purchased for them. ...<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>These things being granted ... we hope to see the now
contemned ordinances of God highly prized ... To conclude,
all businesses in church and commonwealth (which for many
years have seemed to go backward ...) successfully thriving....</p>

<h4>87. Punishment for not Attending "Approved" Churches, 1666</h4>

Hutchinson adds in a note that the three persons here condemned were

<p class="center">At a county court held at Cambridge, on adjournment,
                           Aprill 17. 1666.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Goold</span>, Thomas Osburne and John George being
presented by the grand jury of this county for absenting
themselves from the publick worship of God on the Lords
dayes for one whole yeare now past, alledged respectively
as followeth, viz.</p>

<p>Thomas Osburne answered, that the reason of his non-attendance
was, that the Lord hath discovered unto him from
his word and spirit of truth that the society, wherewith he
is now in communion, is more agreeable to the will of God:
asserted that they were a church and attended the worship
of God together, and do judge themselves bound so to do, the
ground whereof he said he gave in the general court.</p>

<p>Thomas Goold answered, that as for coming to publique
worship they did meet in publique worship according to the
rule of Christ, the grounds whereof they had given to the
court of assistants: asserted that they were a publique meeting,
according to the order of Christ Jesus gathered together.</p>

<p>John George answered, that he did attend the publique
meetings on the Lord's dayes where he was a member; asserted
that they were a church according to the order of Christ
in the gospell, and with them he walked and held communion
in the publique worship of God on the Lord's dayes.</p>

<p>Whereas at the general court in October last, and at the
court of assistants in September last endeavours were used
for their conviction [and that] the order of the generall court
declaring the said Goold and company to be no orderly church
assembly and that they stand convicted of high presumption
against the Lord and his holy appoyntments was openly read
to them and is on file with the records of this court:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The court sentenced</i> the said Thomas Goold, Thomas Osburne,
and John George, for their absenting themselves from the
publique worship of God on the Lords dayes, to pay foure
pounds fine, each of them, to the county order. And whereas
by their owne confessions they stand convicted of persisting
in their schismaticall assembling themselves together, to the
great dishonour of God and our profession of his holy name,
contrary to the act of the generall court of October last
prohibiting them therein on penalty of imprisonment, this
court doth order their giving bond respectively in 20<i>l.</i> each
of them, for their appearance to answer their contempt at the
next court of assistants.</p>

<p>The abovenamed Thomas Goold, John George, and Thomas
Osburne made their appeale to the next court of assistants,
and refusing to put in security according to law were committed
to prison.</p>

<p>... 2. TWELVE Strangers in that Country, but free-born
of this Nation, <span class="antiqua">received twenty three Whippings</span>, the most of
them being with a Whip <i>ofthree Cords</i>, with <i>Knots at the ends</i>,
and laid on with as much strength as they could be by the
Arm of their Executioner, the stripes amounting to <i>Three
hundred and seventy</i>.</p>

<p>3. Eighteen Inhabitants of the Country, being free-born
<i>English</i>, received <span class="antiqua">twenty three Whippings</span>, the stripes amounting
to <span class="antiqua">two hundred and fifty</span>.</p>

<p>4. Sixty four Imprisonments of the Lords People, for their
obedience to his Will, amounting to <span class="antiqua">five hundred and nineteen
weeks</span>, much of it being <i>very cold weather</i>, and the Inhabitants
kept in Prison <i>in harvest time</i>, which was very much to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
losse; besides many more Imprisoned, of which time we cannot
give a just account.</p>

<p>5. Two beaten with <span class="antiqua">Pitched Ropes</span>, the blows amounting to
<span class="antiqua">an hundred thirty nine</span>, by which one of them was brought near
unto death, much of his body being beat <span class="antiqua">like unto a jelly</span>, and
one of their own Doctors, a Member of their Church, who saw
him, said, <i>It would be a Miracle if ever he recovered, he expecting
the flesh should rot off the bones</i>; who afterwards was banished
upon pain of death. There are many Witnesses of this there.</p>

<p>6. Also, an Innocent man, an Inhabitant of <i>Boston</i>, they
<span class="antiqua">banished</span> from his Wife and Children, and put to seek a habitation
in the Winter; and in case he returned again, he was
to be kept Prisoner during his life: and for returning again,
he was put in Prison, and hath been now a Prisoner above a
year.</p>

<p>7. Twenty five <span class="antiqua">Banishments</span>, upon the penalties of being
<span class="antiqua">whipt</span>, or having <span class="antiqua">their Ears cut</span>; or <span class="antiqua">branded in the Hand</span>, if they
returned.</p>

<p>8. Fines laid upon the Inhabitants for meeting together,
and edifying one another, as the Saints ever did; and for
<span class="antiqua">refusing to swear</span>, it being contrary to Christ's Command,
amounting to <span class="antiqua">about a Thousand pound</span>, besides what they have
done since, that we have not heard of; many Families, in
which there are many Children, are almost ruined, by these
unmerciful proceedings.</p>

<p>9. Five kept <i>Fifteen dayes</i> (in all) <i>without food</i>, and <i>Fifty
eight</i> dayes shut up close by the Jaylor, and had none that he
knew of; and from some of them he stopt up the windows,
hindring them from convenient air.</p>

<p>10. One laid <span class="antiqua">Neck and Heels</span> in Irons for <i>sixteen hours</i>.</p>

<p>11. One <span class="antiqua">very deeply burnt</span> in the right hand <i>with the letter</i> H.
after he had been whipt with above <i>Thirty stripes</i>.</p>

<p>12. One chained the most part of Twenty dayes to a Logg
of wood in an open Prison in the Winter-time.</p>

<p>13. Five Appeals to <i>England</i>, denied at <i>Boston</i>.</p>

<p>14. Three <span class="antiqua">had their right Ears cut by the Hangman in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Prison</span>, the Door being barred, and not a Friend suffered to be
present while it was doing, though some much desired it.</p>

<p>15. One of the Inhabitants of <i>Salem</i>, who since is banished
upon pain of Death, <i>had one half of his House and Land seized
on while he was in Prison</i>, a month before he knew of it.</p>

<p>16. At a General Court in <i>Boston</i>, they made an Order,
<span class="antiqua">That those who had not wherewithal to answer the ffines that were
laid upon them</span> (for their Consciences) <span class="antiqua">should be sold for Bond=men,
and Bond=women to</span> Barbados, Virginia, <span class="antiqua">or any of the</span> English
<span class="antiqua">Plantations</span>.</p>

<p>17. Eighteen of the people of God were at several times
banished <span class="antiqua">upon pain of Death</span>, six of them were their own Inhabitants,
two of which being very aged people, and well
known among their Neighbours to be of honest Conversations,
being Banished from their Houses and Families, and put upon
Travelling and other hardships, soon ended their dayes; whose
Death we can do no lesse than charge upon the Rulers of
<i>Boston</i>, they being the occasion of it.</p>

<p>18. Also three of the Servants of the Lord <span class="antiqua">they put to
Death</span>, all of them for obedience to the Truth, in the Testimony
of it against the wicked Rulers and Laws at <i>Boston</i>.</p>

<p>19. And since they have banished four more, <i>upon pain of
Death</i>; and twenty four of the Inhabitants of <i>Salem</i> were
presented, and more Fines called for, and their Goods seized
on, to the value of Forty pounds, for meeting together in the
fear of God, and some for <i>refusing to swear</i>.</p>

<p>These things (O King) from time to time have we patiently
suffered, and not for the trangression of any Just or Righteous
Law, either pertaining to the Worship of God, or the Civil
Government of <i>England</i>, but simply and barely for our Consciences
to God, of which we can more at large give Thee
(or whom thou mayest order) a full Account (if Thou wilt let
us have admission to Thee, who are <i>Banished upon pain of
Death</i>, and have had <i>our Ears cut</i>, who are, some of us, in
<i>England</i> attending upon Thee) both of the <i>Causes of our
Sufferings</i>, and <i>the Manner</i> of their disorderly and illegal Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>ceeding
against us; who begun <span class="antiqua">with Immodesty</span>, went on in
<span class="antiqua">Inhumanity</span> and <span class="antiqua">Cruelty</span>, and were not satisfied until <span class="antiqua">they had
the Blood of three of the Martyrs of</span> JESUS: Revenge for all
which we do not seek, but lay them before Thee, considering
Thou hast been well acquainted with Sufferings, and so mayest
the better consider them that suffer, and mayest for the future
restrain the Violence of these Rulers of <i>New-England</i>, having
Power in Thy hands; they being but the Children of the
Family, of which Thou art Chief Ruler; Who have in divers
of their Proceedings <span class="antiqua">forfeited their Patent</span>; as upon a strict
Inquiry in many particulars will appear.</p>

<p>And this, O King, we are assured of, that in time to come it
will not repent Thee, if by a <i>Close Rebuke</i> Thou stoppest the
<span class="antiqua">Bloody Proceedings</span> of these <span class="antiqua">Bloody Persecutors</span>; for in so doing,
Thou wilt engage the hearts of many honest People unto
Thee, both there and here; and for such Works of Mercy, the
Blessing is obtained, and shewing it, is the way to prosper....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anno 1661.</span> At the said next General-Court, <i>Wenlock Christison</i>
was again brought to the Bar.</p>

<p>The Governour asked him, <i>What he had to say for himself, why
he should not die?</i></p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> I have done nothing worthy of Death; if I had,
I refuse not to die.</p>

<p>Governour. <i>Thou art come in among us in Rebellion, which is
as the Sin of Witchcraft, and ought to be punished.</i></p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> I came not in among you in Rebellion, but in Obedience
to the God of Heaven; not in Contempt to any of you,
but in Love to your Souls and Bodies; and that you shall know
one Day, when you and all Men must give an Account of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Deeds done in the Body. Take heed, for you cannot escape
the righteous Judgments of God.</p>

<p>Major-General <i>Adderton</i>. <i>You pronounce Woes and Judgments,
and those that are gone before you pronounced Woes and
Judgments; but the Judgments of the Lord God are not come upon
us yet.</i></p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> Be not proud, neither let your Spirits be lifted up;
God doth but wait till the Measure of your Iniquity be filled
up, and that you have seen your ungodly Race, then will the
Wrath of God come upon you to the uttermost; And as for
thy part, it hangs over thy Head, and is near to be poured
down upon thee, and shall come as a Thief in the Night suddenly,
when thou thinkest not of it. By what Law will ye
put me to Death?</p>

<p>Court. <i>We have a Law, and by our Law you are to die.</i></p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> So said the <i>Jews</i> of Christ, <i>We have a Law, and
by our Law he ought to die.</i> Who empowered you to make
that Law?</p>

<p>Court. <i>We have a</i> Patent, <i>and are</i> Patentees; <i>judge whether
we have not Power to make Laws?</i></p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> How! Have you Power to make Laws repugnant
to the Laws of <i>England</i>?</p>

<p>Governour. <i>Nay.</i></p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> Then you are gone beyond your Bounds, and have
forfeited your <i>Patent</i>, and this is more than you can answer.
Are you Subjects to the King, yea, or nay?</p>

<p>Secretary <i>Rawson</i>. <i>What will you infer from that? what Good
will that do you?</i></p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> If you are, say so; for in your Petition to the
King, you desire that he will protect you, and that you may be
worthy to kneel among his loyal Subjects.</p>

<p>Court. <i>Yes.</i></p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> So am I, and for any thing I know, am as good as
you, if not better; for if the King did but know your Hearts,
as God knows them, he would see, that your Hearts are as
rotten towards him, as they are towards God. Therefore see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>ing
that you and I are Subjects to the King, I demand to be
tried by the Laws of my own Nation.</p>

<p>Court. <i>You shall be tried by a Bench and a Jury.</i></p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> That is not the Law, but the Manner of it; for if
you will be as good as your word, you must set me at Liberty,
for I never heard or read of any Law that was in <i>England</i> to
hang <i>Quakers</i>.</p>

<p>Governour. <i>There is a Law to hang</i> Jesuits.</p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> If you put me to Death, it is not because I go under
the name of a <i>Jesuit</i>, but a <i>Quaker</i>, therefore I do appeal to the
Laws of my own Nation.</p>

<p>Court. <i>You are in our Hand, and have broken our Laws, and
we will try you.</i></p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> Your Will is your Law, and what you have Power
to do, that you will do: And seeing that the Jury must go
forth on my Life, this I have to say to you in the Fear of the
Living God: Jury, take heed what you do, for you swear by
the Living God, <i>That you will true Trial make, and just Verdict
give, according to the Evidence.</i> Jury, look for your Evidence:
What have I done to deserve Death? Keep your Hands out
of innocent Blood.</p>

<p>A Juryman. <i>It is good Counsel.</i></p>

<p>The Jury went out, but having received their Lesson, soon
returned, and brought in their Verdict <i>Guilty</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> I deny all Guilt, for my Conscience is clear in
the Sight of God.</p>

<p>Governour. <i>The Jury hath condemned thee.</i></p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> The Lord doth justify me; who art thou that condemnest?</p>

<p>Then the Court proceeded to vote as to the Sentence of
Death, to which several of them, <i>viz. Richard Russel</i> and
others, would not consent, the Innocence and Stedfastness of
the Man having prevailed upon them in his Favour. There
happened also a Circumstance during this Trial, which could
not but affect Men of any Tenderness or Consideration, which
was, that a Letter was sent to the Court from <i>Edward Wharton</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
signifying, <i>That whereas they had banished him on pain of Death,
yet he was at Home in his own House in</i> Salem, and therefore
proposing, <i>That they would take off their wicked Sentence from
him, that he might go about his Occasions out of their Jurisdiction</i>.
This Circumstance, however affecting to others, did only enrage
<i>Endicot</i> the Governour, who was very much displeased,
and in much Anger cried out, <i>I could find in my Heart to go
Home</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> It were better for thee to be at Home than here,
for thou art about a bloody piece of Work.</p>

<p>Governour. <i>You that will not consent, record it. I thank
God, I am not afraid to give Judgment.</i> Wenlock Christison,
<i>hearken to your Sentence: You must return unto the Place from
whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, and
there you must be hanged until you be</i> dead, dead, dead, <i>upon the
13th Day of</i> June, <i>being the Fifth-day of the Week.</i></p>

<p><i>Wenlock.</i> The Will of the Lord be done: In whose Will I
came amongst you, and in his Counsel I stand, feeling his
Eternal Power, that will uphold me unto the last Gasp, I do
not question it. Known be it unto you all, That if you have
Power to take my Life from me, my Soul shall enter into
Everlasting Rest and Peace with God, where you yourselves
shall never come: And if you have Power to take my Life
from me, the which I do question, I believe you shall never
more take <i>Quakers</i> Lives from them: Note my Words. Do
not think to weary out the Living God by taking away the
Lives of his Servants: What do you gain by it? For the
last Man you put to Death, here are <i>five</i> come in his Room.
And if you have Power to take my Life from me, God can
raise up the same Principle of Life in <i>ten</i> of his Servants, and
send them among you in my Room, that you may have Torment
upon Torment, which is your Portion: <i>For there is no
Peace to the Wicked</i>, saith my God.</p>

<p>Governour. <i>Take him away. ...</i></p>

<p>[In many ways this "compact" recalls the Mayflower Compact
(No. 46); but the notable thing here is that obedience is promised in
<i>civil</i> things only. "Civil" is used in contradistinction with "ecclesi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>astical."
Obedience is promised in matters that pertain to the <i>state</i>, not
in those pertaining to the church. This was the primary force of the
word "civil." Observe it in the same sense in the documents that

<h4>90. Religious Freedom Consonant with Civil Order</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Arnold's <i>History of Rhode Island</i>, I, 254, 255.</p>

<p>The town of Providence had been disturbed by tumults, and some of
the inhabitants reasoned loosely that their platform of freedom of conscience
forbade them to punish the transgressors. Williams then wrote
the following letter to the town, defining in a masterly way the limits of
civil and religious freedom. This is a good point at which to review No. 84,
with the Introduction thereto.</p></div>

<p>There goes many a ship to sea, with many hundred souls
in one ship, whose weal and woe is common; and [this] is
a true picture of a commonwealth. ... It hath fallen out
sometimes that both Papists and Protestants, Jews and Turks,
may be embarked in one ship; upon which supposal I affirm
that all the liberty of conscience, that ever I pleaded for, turns
upon these two hinges: that none of the Papists, Protestants,
Jews, or Turks, be forced to come to the ship's prayers or
worship, nor compelled from their own particular prayers or
worship, if they practice any. I further add that I never
denied that, notwithstanding this liberty, the commander of
the ship ought to command the ship's course, yea, and also
command that justice, peace, and sobriety be kept and practised,
both among the seamen and all the passengers. If any
of the seamen refuse to perform their service, or passengers
to pay their freight; if any refuse to help, in person or purse,
toward the common charges or defence; if any refuse to obey
the common laws and orders of the ship, concerning their
common peace or preservation; if any shall mutiny and rise
up against their ... officers; if any should preach or write
that there ought to be no commanders or officers because all
are equal in Christ ... I say I never denied but in such cases,
whatever is pretended, the commander or commanders may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
judge, resist, compel, and punish such trangressors, according
to their ... merits.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>The Long Parliament, at the opening of its war against Charles I, created
a council for colonial affairs. That body, upon petition from Williams
and his friends, issued the following grant. Section I (about a page of this

Inhabitants, of the Towns of Providence, Portsmouth, and Newport

which may in Time by the blessing of God upon their
Endeavours, lay a sure Foundation of Happiness to all America.
And have also purchased, and are purchasing of and amongst the
said Natives, some other Places, which may be convenient both
for Plantations, and also for building of Ships, Supply of Pipe
Staves and other Merchandize. And whereas the said English,
have represented their Desire to the said Earl, and Commissioners,
to have their hopeful Beginnings approved and confirmed,
by granting unto them a Free Charter of Civil Incorporation and
Government; that they may order and govern their Plantation
in such a Manner as to maintain Justice and peace, both among
themselves, and towards all Men with whom they shall have

Robert Earl of Warwick, Governor in Chief, and Lord High

Charter of Incorporation, to be known by the Name of the
Incorporation of Providence Plantations, in the Narraganset-Bay,
in New England.&mdash;Together with full Power and
Authority to rule themselves, and such others as shall hereafter
inhabit within any Part of the said Tract of land, by
such a Form of <b>Civil Government</b>, as by voluntary consent of
all, or the greater Part of them, they shall find most suitable
to their Estate and Condition; and, for that End, to make
and ordain such <b>Civil Laws</b> and Constitutions, and to inflict
such punishments upon Transgressors, and for Execution thereof,
so to place, and displace Officers of Justice, as they, or the
greatest Part of them, shall by free Consent agree unto.
Provided nevertheless, that the said Laws, Constitutions, and
Punishments, for the <b>Civil Government</b> of the said Plantations,
be conformable to the Laws of England, so far as the Nature
and Constitution of the place will admit. And always
reserving to the said Earl, and Commissioners, and their
Successors, Power and Authority for to dispose the general
Government of that, as it stands in Relation to the rest of the

<p>Much honoured Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Please you to understand, that there hath come to our view a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
letter subscribed by the honour'd gentlemen commissioners of
the united coloneys, the contents whereof are a request concerning
certayne people caled quakers, come among us lately, etc.</p>

<p>Our desires are, in all things possible, to pursue after and
keepe fayre and loving correspondence and entercourse with
all the colloneys, and with all our countreymen in New-England;
and to that purpose we have endeavoured (and shall still
endeavour) to answere the desires and requests from all parts of
the countrey, coming unto us, in all just and equall returnes,
to which end the coloney have made seasonable provision to
preserve a just and equal entercourse between the coloneys
and us, by giving justice to any that demand it among us and
by returning such as make escapes from you, or from the other
coloneys, being such as fly from the hands of justice, for matters
of crime done or committed amongst you, etc. And as concerning
these quakers (so caled) which are now among us, <i>we
have no law among us whereby to punish any for only declaring
by words, etc. their mindes and understandings concerning the
things and ways of God, as to salvation and an eternal condition.
And we, moreover, finde that in those places where these people
aforesaid, in this coloney, are most of all suffered to declare themselves
freely, and are only oposed by arguments in discourse, there
they least of all desire to come, and we are informed that they begin
to loath this place, for that they are not opposed by the civill
authority, but with all patience and meeknes are suffered to say
over their pretended revelations and admonitions, nor are they like
or able to gain many here to their way; and surely we find that
they delight to be persecuted by civill powers, and when they are
soe, they are like to gain more adherents by the conseyte of their patient
sufferings, than by consent to their pernicious sayings</i>. And
yet we conceive, that their doctrines trend to very absolute cutting
downe and overturning relations and civill government
among men, if generally received. But as to the dammage that
may in likelyhood accrue to the neighbour colloneys by their being
here entertained, we conceive it will not prove so dangerous
(as else it might) in regard of the course taken by you to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
them away out of the countrey, as they come among you. But,
however, at present, we judge it requisitt (and doe intend) to
commend the consideration of their extravagent outgoings unto
the generall assembly of our coloney in March next, where we
hope there will be such order taken, as may, in all honest and
contientious manner, prevent the bad effects of their doctrines
and endeavours; and soe, in all courtious and loving respects,

<p>[<b>Hints for Study.</b>&mdash;<b>1.</b>&mdash;This was a great democratic constitution,&mdash;the
first that ever "created a state." <b><i>As a whole, it is an innovation; but very
few passages in it, taken by themselves, are new.</i></b> The great bulk of the
Orders came from Massachusetts' practice of the preceding five years
(1634-1638), and most of it came, indeed, from express statutes of the
older colony. Its peculiar democracy consisted in (1) <i>selecting</i> all the
democratic features of the Massachusetts government (leaving out all the
more aristocratic features), and (2) in <i>adding</i> a very few other democratic
features, some of which these men had striven for in vain in Massachusetts.</p>


<p><i>a.</i> For instances of selection:</p>

<p>(Article 1.) Massachusetts, during most of her history, had had "two
General Courts," the Spring Court being a "Courte of Election," in
which all magistrates were chosen for one year only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>(Articles 1, 2, 7, 9.) All the details of the elections of governor, magistrates,
and town deputies, come from Massachusetts' <i>practice</i> in the years
1635-1638, as did also the provision for preliminary caucusing by the
deputies with control over their separate meetings.</p>

<p>Articles 5 and 10 may be compared with the democratic legislation of
Massachusetts in 1634 (No. 67 <i>b</i> (2), above).</p>

<p>Many minor resemblances will occur to the advanced student familiar
with Massachusetts history.</p>


<p><i>b.</i> Provisions which the democrats had wanted, but failed to secure,
in Massachusetts: ineligibility of the governor for immediate
re&euml;lection (Article 4), and the method of nomination (Article 3; adopted
also in Massachusetts two years later).</p>


<p><i>c.</i> Democratic innovations: (1) making the sessions of the legislature
independent of the will of the executive (Articles 6 and 10). Massachusetts
had made the General Court master of its own adjournment but
not of its meetings. Both the provisions were adopted by the Long
Parliament in England two years later. (2) Leaving the franchise to be
determined practically by the towns.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Connecticut <b>did not reject theocracy</b>. Cf. the preamble and the
eligibility provision for the governorship. In practice, too, the colony
maintained a close union of Church and State. The restriction of the
franchise to church members was rejected, not because it was theocratic,
but because it was undemocratic.]</p>

to our desire) with convenience communicate in one Government,
and Jurisdiction; and whereas we live encompassed
with people of severall Nations, and strange languages, which
hereafter may prove injurious to us, and our posterity: And
forasmuch as the Natives have formerly committed sundry insolencies
and outrages upon severall Plantations of the English,
and have of late combined against us. And seeing by reason
of the sad distractions in <i>England</i>, which they have heard of,
and by which they know we are hindred both from that humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
way of seeking advice, and reaping those comfortable fruits of
protection which, at other times, we might well expect; we
therefore doe conceive it our bounden duty, without delay, to
enter into a present Consotiation amongst our selves, for
mutuall help and strength in all our future concernments, that,
as in Nation, and Religion, so, in other respects, we be, and
continue, One, according to the tenour and true meaning of the
ensuing Articles.</p>

<p>I. Wherefore it is fully Agreed and Concluded by and between
the parties, or Jurisdictions above named, and they doe
joyntly and severally by these presents agree and conclude,
That they all be, and henceforth be called by the name of, <i>The
United Colonies of New-England</i>.</p>

<p>II. The said United Colonies for themselves, and their posterties
doe joyntly and severally hereby enter into a firm and
perpetuall league of friendship and amity, for offence and defence,
mutuall advice and succour, upon all just occasions, both
for preserving and propagating the truth, and liberties of the
Gospel, and for their own mutuall safety, and wellfare.</p>

<p>III. It is further agreed, That the Plantations which at
present are, or hereafter shall be settled within the limits of
the <i>Massachusets</i>, shall be forever under the Government of
the <i>Massachusets</i>. And shall have peculiar Jurisdiction
amongst themselves, as an intire body; and that <i>Plimouth</i>,
<i>Connecticut</i>, and <i>New-Haven</i>, shall each of them, in all respects,
have the like peculiar Jurisdiction, and Government within
their limits....</p>

<p>IV. It is also by these Confederates agreed, That the charge
of all just Wars, whether offensive, or defensive, upon what
part or Member of this Confederation soever they fall, shall
both in men, provisions, and all other disbursements, be born
by all the parts of this Confederation, in different proportions,
according to their different abilities, in manner following,
namely, That the Commissioners for each Jurisdiction, from
time to time, as there shall be occasion, bring a true account
and number of all the Males in each Plantation, or any way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
belonging to, or under their severall Jurisdictions, of what
quality, or condition soever they be, from sixteen years old,
to threescore, being inhabitants there. And that according
to the different numbers, which from time to time shall be
found in each Jurisdiction, upon a true, and just account, the
service of men, and all charges of the war, be born by the
poll: Each Jurisdiction, or Plantation, being left to their own
just course, and custome, of rating themselves, and people,
according to their different estates, with due respect to their
qualities and exemptions among themselves, though the Confederation
take no notice of any such priviledge. And that,
according to the different charge of each Jurisdiction, and
Plantation, the whole advantage of the War (if it please God
so to blesse their endeavours) whether it be in Lands, Goods,
or persons, shall be proportionably divided among the said
Confederates.</p>

<p>V. It is further agreed, That if any of these Jurisdictions,
or any Plantation under, or in Combination with them, be
invaded by any enemy whomsoever, upon notice, and request
of any three Magistrates of that Jurisdiction so invaded,
The rest of the Confederates, without any further meeting or
expostulation, shall forthwith send ayde to the Confederate in
danger, but in different proportion, namely the <i>Massachusets</i>
one hundred men sufficiently armed, and provided for such a
service, and journey. And each of the rest five and forty
men, so armed and provided, or any lesse number, if lesse be
required, according to this proportion. ... But none of the
Jurisdictions to exceed these numbers, till by a meeting of the
Commissioners ... a greater ayde appear necessary....</p>

<p>VI. It is also agreed, That for the managing and concluding
of all affaires proper to, and concerning the whole
Confederation, two Commissioners shall be chosen by, and out
of the foure Jurisdictions, namely two for the <i>Massachusets</i>,
two for <i>Plimouth</i>, two for <i>Connecticut</i>, and two for <i>New-haven</i>,
being all in Church-fellowship with us, which shall bring full
power from their severall generall Courts respectively, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
hear, examine, weigh, and determine all affaires of war, or
peace, leagues, aydes, charges, and numbers of men for war,
division of spoyles, or whatsoever is gotten by conquest, receiving
of more confederates, or Plantations into Combination
with any of these Confederates, and all things of like nature,
which are the proper concomitants, or consequences of such a
Confederation, for amity, offence, and defence, not intermedling
with the Government or any of the Jurisdictions, which by
the third Article, is preserved entirely to themselves. But if
these eight Commissioners when they meet, shall not all agree,
yet it is concluded, <b>That any six of the eight agreeing, shall
have power to settle and determine the businesse in question</b>.
<b>But if six doe not agree, that then such Propositions</b>, with their
Reasons, so far as they have been debated, <b>be sent, and referred
to the foure Generall Courts</b>, <i>viz.</i> The Massachusetts, Plymouth,
Connectecut, and New-haven. ... It is further agreed, That
these eight Commissioners shall meet once every year, besides
extraordinary meetings, according to the fifth Article to consider,
treat, and conclude of all affaires belonging to this
Confederation, which meeting shall ever be the first <i>Thursday</i>
in <i>September</i>. [Provision for meeting at the several capital
cities in rotation.]</p>

<p>VII. It is further agreed, That at each meeting of these
eight Commissioners, whether ordinary or extraordinary; they
all, or any six of them agreeing as before, may choose their
President out of themselves ... [to secure] a comely carrying
on of all proceedings in the present meeting. But he shall be
invested with no such power or respect, as by which, he shall
hinder the propounding or progresse of any businesse, or any
way cast the scales, otherwise then in the precedent Article is
agreed.</p>

<p>VIII. It is also agreed, That the Commissioners for this
Confederation hereafter at their meetings, whether ordinary or
extraordinary, as they may have Commission or opportunity,
doe endeavour to frame and establish Agreements and Orders
in generall cases of a civil nature, wherein all the Plantations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
are interested, for preserving peace amongst themselves, and
preventing (as much as may be) all occasions of war, or differences
with others, as about the free and speedy passage of
Justice in each Jurisdiction, to all the Confederates equally,
as to their own, receiving those that remove from one Plantation
to another, without due Certificates, how all the Jurisdictions
may carry it towards the <i>Indians</i>, that they neither
grow insolent, nor be injured without due satisfaction, least
War break in upon the Confederates, through such miscarriages.
It is also agreed, That if any Servant run away from his
Master, into any other of these Confederated Jurisdictions,
That in such case, upon the Certificate of one Magistrate in
the Jurisdiction, out of which the said Servant fled, or upon
other due proof, the said Servant shall be delivered either to
his Master, or any other that pursues, and brings such Certificate,
or proof. And that upon the escape of any Prisoner
whatsoever, or fugitive, for any Criminall Cause, whether
breaking Prison, or getting from the Officer, or otherwise
escaping, upon the Certificate of two Magistrates of the Jurisdiction
out of which the escape is made, that he was a prisoner
or such an offendor, at the time of the escape, the Magistrates
of that Jurisdiction where for the present the said prisoner or
fugitive abideth, shall forthwith grant such a Warrant as the
case will bear, for the apprehending of any such person, and
the delivery of him into the hand of the person who pursueth
him....</p>

<p>[IX. No one of the confederates to engage in any (offensive)
war, without the vote of the commissioners, "as in the sixth
Article is provided."]</p>

<p>XI. It is further agreed, That if any of the Confederates
shall hereafter break any of these presents Articles, or be any
other way injurious to any one of the other Jurisdictions, such
breach of Agreement, or injury, shalbe duly considered and
ordered by the Commissioners for the other Jurisdictions, that
both peace, and this present Confederation, may be intirely
preserved without violation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, this perpetuall Confederation, and the severall

<p class="center">(1) <i>At a meetinge of the Commissioners for the united Colonies
       in New England at Hartford the fift of September 1644</i></p>

<p>... The Commissioners for the Massachusetts mooved that
a due order might be attended in the subscriptions of the
Acts and determinacions of this and any future meetings of
the Commissioners for the united Colonies, and expressed not
onely their owne apprehensions but the judgment of their
generall Court, That by the Articles of Confederacion the first
place did of Right belong to the Massachusetts, as being first
named and so the other Colonies in like order. Which being
taken into consideracion, and the Articles of Confederacion
read, It appeared evidently to the Comissioners that no such
priviledge had beene ever ... graunted ... by the Comissioners
for the Jurisdicions in either of their former meetings,
and yet the first subscription was made in the presence of the
generall Court of the Massachusetts. And to prevent future
inconvenience upon this occation, they thought fitt to declare
that this Commission is free and may not receive any thing
(not expresly agreed in the Articles) as imposed by any
generall Court; yet out of their respects to the Government
of the Massachusetts they did <i>willingly</i> graunt that their
Comissioners [those of Massachusetts] should first subscribe
after the President in this and all future meetings, and the
Comissioners for the other Colonies in such order as they are
named in the Articles; viz., Plymouth, Conectacutt, and New
Haven.</p>

<p>... the Comissioners for the Matathusetts presented to
the Comissioners of the other Colonyes a writeing from a
Comitee of theire Generall Courte desiering that a dew

<h4>96. Nullification by Massachusetts</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Plymouth Colony Records</i>, X, 74-76. Cf. <i>American History and
Government</i>, &sect; 93. The following extracts from a declaration of the
Massachusetts General Court put an end to the attempt of the other
three colonies in the New England Confederation to force Massachusetts
to join in a war against New Netherlands.</p></div>

<p><i>The question propounded by the General Court of the Massachusetts</i>
[<i>June 2/12, 1653</i>].</p>

<p>... Whether the Comissioners of the united Collonies have
power by articles of agreement to determine the Justice of an
offencive or vindictive warr and to engage the Collonies therin;</p>

<p>The Answare of the Committies to the question,&mdash;first more
particularly from the Articles:</p>

<p>The whole power of Government and Jurisdiction is in the
3d and sixt Articles refered to every Collonie whoe sawe not
meet to divest themselves of theire authoritie to Invest the
Comissioners with any part therof being altogether unsafe and
unnessesary to attaine the end of the Confeaderation;</p>

<p>The 9. and 10th Articles constituteth the Comissioners
Judges of the Justice of a defencive warr</p>

<p>The 4th and 5th settle Rules for Leagues, Aides, and number
in a defencive warr, and devisions of spoiles; but noe
where provide for the determination of the Justice of an
offencive warr, which therfore is refered wholy to the Determination
of the Supreame Power of the severall Confeaderate
Jurisdictions, whoe would have otherwise provided in the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>The sixt Article, which att first view seemes to Inable the
Comissioners, will evidently evince the Contrary. For, the
Confederation being betwixt the Collonies, the 4th, and fift, 9,
and 10th Articles provid Rules in severall Cases according to
which the Confeaderates have bound themselves to Acte;
And the sixt Article onely orders and appoints whoe and in
what mannor the said Rules and agreements should bee executed
viz. by Comissioners Improved to acte in cases
specif[y]ed and regulated,&mdash;for theire number, mannor of
proceeding, times and places of meeting, in the sixt and
seaventh Articles; And that by nessesitie; because the
supreame power of the severall Jurisdictions Could not assemble,
they were enforced to Substitute deligates to order
such things as were of present and urgent Nessesitie, or meerly
prudenciall or polliticall or of Inferior nature, and that according
to <i>themselves</i> [the Rules] prescribed by the Confeaderates.
But such things [as] require the Choise Actes of
Authoritie; or [are] in theire nature of Morrall Consideration
and may admite of more time of Deliberation (as an offencive
warr), The Wisdome of the Countrivers of the Confederacy
did not Judg meete to Refere to Comissioners, and therfore
[they] have not provided any Rules in such cases in these
Consernments as they did in all cases of an Inferior nature;</p>

<p><i>More Generally</i>:<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The Comissioners of the united Collonies
are not, soe fare as wee can deserne, Invested with power to
Conclude an offencive warr to engage the Collonies to which
they belonge to put the same in execution further then they
are enabled by Comission or Instructions under the seale of
theire Collonie; much lesse can it stand with the Jurisdiction
and Right of Government reserved to ever[y] Collonie for six
Comissioners of the other Collonies to put forth any Acte of
power in a vindictive warr wherby they shall comaund the
Collonie decenting to assist them in the same; neither can it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>bee the meaning of the severall Collonies whoe are soe tender
of theire power in Governing theire owne that they should
put theire power out of theire owne hands in the most waighty
points (A bondage hardly to bee borne by the most Subjective
people), And cannot bee conceived soe free a people as the
united Collonies should submite unto;</p>

<p>It can bee noe lesse then <i>a contradiction</i> to affeirme the
Supreame power (which wee take to bee the Generall Courts
of every Jurisdiction) can bee comaunded by others: <i>an absurditie
in pollicye</i>, that an Intire Government and Jurisdiction
should prostitute itselfe to the Comaund of Strangers; <i>a
Scandall in Religion</i>, that a generall court of Christians should
bee oblidged to acte and engage upon the faith of six Delligates
against theire Consience;&mdash;all which must bee admited in
case wee acknowlidg ourselves bound to undertake an offencive
warr upon the bare determination of the Comissioners, whoe
can not nor ever did challenge Authoritie over us, or expecte
Subjection from us....</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Observe that the Massachusetts government did flatly nullify a decree
of the federal congress of the United Colonies. However, it tried to
justify itself, not by an avowal of its power, but by a constitutional argument.
Massachusetts claimed first that the sixth article (which made the
vote of six commissioners binding upon the whole confederation) could
apply only to such matters as have been plainly referred to the Commissioners
by other parts of the Constitution; and second, that the authority
claimed by the federal Congress was inconsistent with the fundamental
idea of a confederation, even as it had been understood by the other
confederates.</p>

<p>John Fiske says that this argument begins "the development of constitutional
law, in the American sense,"&mdash;as an attempt to interpret a
written constitution. The whole debate makes an interesting prelude to
the later arguments of the nullifiers and secessionists in the nineteenth
century.]</p></div>

<p>The complete document would fill some ten pages of this volume. Parts
of it are plainly copied from the Massachusetts Bay charter of 1629. Indeed
the whole document has the <i>form</i> of a charter to a <i>proprietary</i>
"<i>Company</i>." This company, however, was a "<i>Corporation upon the
place</i>," not a corporation in England managing a distant property. It
was the first such corporation to receive a grant from the crown.</p>

<p>The parts of the charter here given are selected to show (1) the powers
of self-government and (2) the inclusion of New Haven. The charter
was adopted as the State Constitution in 1776, and continued in force,
with very slight change, until 1818.</p></div>

of Providence Plantations, in the Narragansett Bay, in New-England,
in America, that they, pursueing, with peaceable and
loyall mindes, their sober, serious and religious intentions, of
godlie edifieing themselves, and one another, in the holie
Christian ffaith and worshipp <i>as they were perswaded</i>: togother
with the gaineing over and conversione of the poore ignorant
Indian natives, in those partes of America, to the sincere professione
and obedienc of the same ffaith and worship, did, not
onlie by the consent and good encouragement of our royall
progenitors, transport themselves out of this kingdome of England
into America, but alsoe, since their arrivall there, after
their first settlement amongst other our subjects in those parts,
ffor the avoideing of discorde, and those manie evills which
were likely to ensue upon some of those oure subjects not beinge
able to beare, in these remote partes, theire different appre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>hensiones
in religious concernments, and in pursueance of the
afforesayd ends, did once againe leave theire desireable stationes
and habitationes, and with excessive labor and travell, hazard
and charge, did transplant themselves into the middest of the
Indian natives, who, as wee are infformed, are the most potent
princes and people of all that country; where, by the good
Providence of God, from whome the Plantationes have taken
their name, upon theire labour and industrie, they have not
onlie byn preserved to admiration, but have increased and
prospered, and are seized and possessed, by purchase and consent
of the said natives, to their ffull content, of such lands,
islands, rivers, harbours and roades, as are verie convenient,
both for plantationes and alsoe for buildinge of shipps, suplye
of pype-staves, and other merchandize; and which lyes verie
commodious, in manie respects, for commerce, and to accomodate
oure southern plantationes, and may much advance the

thereof; they haveinge, by neare neighbourhoode to and
friendlie societie with the greate bodie of the Narragansett

of six sevenths of the legislature. The charter of 1683 was replaced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>by that of 1701 (see <i>b</i>, below); but these "Lawes" were a separate

men without just exception. In cases of life, there shall be

28/November 8, 1701</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives of Pennsylvania</i>,
I, pt. II, i-iii.</p>

<p>A brief statement of the political conditions in the colony previous to
this grant will be found in <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 110. After
a long absence in England, Penn returned to the colony in December,
1699, to find turmoil and confusion. After a few months, it became clear
that Penn must again go back to England promptly to save his proprietary
rights from attacks there; but before he left, he granted, and
the Assembly accepted, this noble charter, which remained the constitution
of the colony until 1776, and which the more conservative patriots
of that Revolutionary day wished to have continued still longer as the
constitution of the independent State.</p>

<h4>104. Berkeley's Report on Virginia, 1671</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hening's <i>Statutes</i>, II, 511-517.</p>

<p>In 1670 the Colonial Board (No. 99, above) sent out questions, which,
with the answers of Governor Berkeley for Virginia (1671), are given below.
Other colonies sent like reports.</p></div>

<p>1. What councils, assemblies, and courts of judicature are
within your government, and of what nature and kind?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> There is a governor and sixteen counsellors, who
have from his sacred majestie, a commission of <i>Oyer and Terminer</i>,
who judge and determine all causes that are above
fifteen pound sterling; for what is under, there are particular
courts in every county, which are twenty in number. <i>Every
year, at least the assembly is called</i>, before whom lye appeals,
and this assembly is composed of two burgesses out of every
county. These lay the necessary taxes, as the necessity of
the war with the Indians, or their exigencies require.</p>

<p>[2. Courts of admiralty.]</p>

<p>3. Where the legislative and executive powers of your
government are seated?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> In the governor, councel and assembly, and officers
substituted by them.</p>

<p>4. What statute laws and ordinances are now ... in force?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> The secretary of this country every year sends to
the lord chancellor, or one of the principal secretaries, what
laws are yearly made; which for the most part concern only
our own private exigencies; for, contrary to the laws of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
we never did, nor dare make any, only this, that no sale of
land is good and legal, unless within three months after the
conveyance it be recorded in the general court, or county
courts.</p>

<p>5. What number of horse and foot are within your government,
and whether they be trained bands or standing forces?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> All our freemen are bound to be trained every
month in their particular counties, which we suppose, and do
not much mistake in the calculation, are near eight thousand
horse: there are more, but it is too chargeable for poor people,
as wee are, to exercise them.</p>

<p>6. (Castles and forts.)</p>

<p>7. What number of privitiers do frequent your coasts ...
the number of their men, and guns, and names of their commanders?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> None to our knowledge, since the late Dutch war.</p>

<p>8. What is the strength of your bordering neighbors, be
they Indians or others ...?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> We have no Europeans seated nearer to us than
St. Christophers or Mexico, that we know of, except some few
ffrench that are beyond New England. The Indians, our
neighbours, are absolutely subjected, so that there is no fear of
them<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>....</p>

<p>9. (Arms, amunition, and stores ... "sent you upon his
majestys account?")</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> ... His majesty in the time of the Dutch warr, sent
us thirty great guns, most of which were lost in the ship that
brought them. [No others sent; some <i>bought</i> by the colony.]</p>

<p>10. What monies have been paid ... by his majesty, or
levied within your government for and towards the buying of
armes or making or maintaining of any ffortifications or castles,
and how have the said monies been expended?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Besides those guns I mentioned, we never had any
monies of his majesty towards the buying of ammunition or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>building of fforts. What monies can be spared out of the
publick revenue, we yearly lay out in ammunition.</p>

<p>11. What are the boundaries and contents of the land,
within your government?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> As for the boundaries of our land, it was once
great, ten degrees in latitude, but now it has pleased his
majesty to confine us to halfe a degree. Knowingly, I speak
this. Pray God it may be for his majesty's service, but I
much fear the contrary.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>12. What commodities are there of the production, growth
and manufacture of your plantation; and particularly, what
materials are there already growing, or may be produced for
shipping in the same?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Commodities of the growth of our country, we
never had any but tobacco, which in this yet is considerable,
that it yields his majesty a great revenue; but of late, we have
begun to make silk, and so many mulberry trees are planted,
and planting, that if we had skilfull men from Naples or
Sicily to teach us the art of making it perfectly, in less than
half an age, we should make as much silk in an year as England
did yearly expend three score years since; but now we
hear it is grown to a greater excess, and more common and
vulgar usage. Now, for shipping, we have admirable masts
and very good oaks; but for iron ore I dare not say there is
sufficient to keep one iron mill going for seven years.</p>

<p>13. Whether saltpetre is or may be produced within your
plantation, and if so, at what rate may it be delivered in England?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Saltpetre, we know of none in the country.</p>

<p>14. What rivers, harbours or roads are there in or about
your plantation and government, and of what depth and
soundings are they?</p>

<p><i>Answer</i>. Rivers, we have four, as I named before, all able,
safely and severally to bear an harbour a thousand ships of the
greatest burthen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>
<p>15. What number of planters, servants and slaves; and how
many parishes are there in your plantation?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> We suppose, and I am very sure we do not much
miscount, that there is in Virginia above forty thousand
persons, men, women and children, and of which there are two
thousand <i>black slaves</i>, six thousand <i>christian servants</i>, for a
short time; the rest are born in the country or have come in to
settle and seat, in bettering their condition in a growing
country.</p>

<p>16. What number of English, Scots, or Irish have for these
seven years past came yearly to plant ... within your
government; as also what <i>blacks</i> or <i>slaves</i> have been brought
in ...?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Yearly we suppose there comes in, of servants,
about fifteen hundred, of which most are English, few Scotch,
and fewer Irish, and not above two or three ships of Negroes
in seven years.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>17. [Mortality? The answer expresses inability to give
exact figures, from lack of a "register office," but insists upon
improvements in health of new immigrants as compared with
earlier times.]</p>

<p>18. What number of ships to trade yearly to and from your
plantations, and of what burthen are they?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> English ships, near eighty, come out of England
and Ireland every year for tobacco; few New England ketches;
<b><i>but of our own we never had yet more than two at one time, and those
not more than twenty tons burthen</i></b>.</p>

<p>19. What obstructions do you find to the improvement of
trade and navigation ...?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> <b><i>Mighty and destructive, by that severe act of parliament
which excludes us the having any commerce with any nation in Europe
but our own.</i></b><a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> [Navigation Acts of 1660, 1663] ... Besides
this, we cannot procure any skillfull men for our now hopefull
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>commodity, silk; for it is not lawfull for us to carry a pipestave
or a barrel of corn to any place in Europe out of the
king's dominions.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> If this were for his majesty's service or
the good of his subjects, we should not repine, whatever our
sufferings ... but on my soul, it is the contrary for both.
And this is the cause why no small or great vessels are built
here;<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> for we are most obedient to all laws, whilst the New
England-men break through, and trade to any place that their
interests lead them.</p>

<p>20. What advantages ... do you observe that may be
gained to your trade or navigation?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> None, unless we had liberty to transport our pipe
staves, timber and corn to other places besides the king's
dominions.</p>

<p>21. What rates and duties are charged and payable upon
any goods exported out of your plantation, whither of your
own growth or manufacture, or otherwise, as also upon goods
imported?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> No goods, either exported or imported, pay any the
least duties here, only two shillings the hogshead on tobacco
exported, which is to defray all public charges; and this year
we could not get an account of more than fifteen thousand
hogsheads, out of which the king allows me a thousand yearly,
with which I must maintain the part of my place, and one
hundred intervening charges that cannot be put to public
account. And I can knowingly affirm, that there is no government
of ten years settlement, but has thrice as much allowed
him. But I am supported by my hopes, that his gracious
majesty will one day consider me.</p>

<p>22. What revenues doe or may arise to his majesty within
your government, and of what nature is it; by whom is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>same collected, and how answered and accounted to his majesty?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> There is no revenue arising to his majesty but out
of the quit-rents; and this he hath given away to a deserving
servant, Col. Henry Norwood.</p>

<p>23. What course is taken about the instructing the people,
within your government in the christian religion ...?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> The same course that is taken in England out of
towns; every man according to his ability instructing his
children. We have fforty eight parishes, and our ministers
are well paid, and by my consent should be better <i>if they
would pray oftener and preach less</i>. But of all other commodities,
so of this, <i>the worst are sent us</i>, and we had few that we
could boast of, since the persicution in <i>Cromwell's</i> tiranny drove
divers worthy men hither. But, I thank God, <i>there are no free
schools</i> nor <i>printing</i>, and I hope we shall not have these hundred
years; for <i>learning</i> has brought disobedience, and heresy, and
sects into the world, and <i>printing</i> has divulged them, and libels
against the best government. God keep us from both!</p>

Rebellion</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Virginia Historical Magazine</i>, II, 166-173, 289-292.</p>

<p>When Bacon's Rebellion had been crushed, royal commissioners arrived
in the colony, with instructions to inform themselves "of all
grievances." The commissioners met the inhabitants at various County
Courts, and took down their complaints in writing. These complaints
show some of the real causes of Bacon's Rebellion. Of course, to these
royal commissioners the people as a rule would say little of infringements
upon political liberty (because commissioners from Charles II could not
be expected to have any sympathy with such complaints), and they
<i>would</i> say much about misgovernment and economic oppression. The
following extracts from the commissioners' records are selected to show
that complaints regarding political oppression did find voice, even under
such conditions. These entries might be greatly extended.</p></div>

<p>(1) <i>Gloster County</i></p>

<p>4. That severall grievances being presented to the June
Assembly [1676] upon which many good Lawes were consented
to by that Assembly [No. 106] ... they Beg those good and
wholesome Lawes may be confirmed.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Lower Norfolk County</i></p>

<p>5. Request for Liberty to Transport their Tobacco to any
of his majesties Plantations without paying the Impost payable
by Act of Parliament. [This request the commissioners
declare "wholly mutinous."]</p>

<p>(3) <i>Surry County</i></p>

<p>1. That the last Assembly continued many yeares....</p>

<p>10. That it has been the custome of County Courts att the
laying of the levy to withdraw into a private Roome,&mdash;by
which meanes the poore people, not knowing for what they
paid, did admire how their taxes could be so high.</p>

<p>12. That, contrary to the lawes of England and this Country,
high sheriffs have usually continued two years, and under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
sheriffs 3 or 4 years together: wee humbly pray that for the
future no person may continue sheriffe above one yeare.</p>

<p>14. That we have not had liberty to choose vestrymen:
wee humbly desire that the wholle parish may have a free
election.</p>

<p>15. That since his most gracious Majesty hath been most
mercifully pleased to pardon our late disloyalty, wee most
earnestly and humbly pray that this present grand assembly
would make an Act of Oblivion,&mdash;that no person may be
injured by the provoking names of Rebell, Traitor and Rogue.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Northampton County</i></p>

<p>2. That we may have Liberty grannted us to choose a new
vestery, and that every three years a new vestery may be
chosen.</p>

<p>6. That it may be graunted us to make a free choyse of six
housekeepers without Interposing of any Ruling Magistratre

the quality and affection of the persons to their government
than the nature of their offence. They see no evill in a church
member, and therefore it is very difficult to get any sentence
or verdict against him, tho' in the smallest matters.</p>

<p>No law is in force or esteeme there but such as are made by
the generall court, and therefore it is accounted a breach of
their privileges and a betraying of the liberties of their commonwealth
to urge the observation of the lawes of England or
his Majesties commands.</p>

<p><i>The lawes most derogatory and contradictory to those of England.</i></p>

<p>All persons of the age of 21 years, being excommunicate or
condemned, have liberty to make wills and dispose of lands
and estates.</p>

<p>In capital cases, dismembering or banishment; where no
law is made by the generall court, or in case of defect of a law
in any particular case, the offender to be tryed by the word of
God and judged by the generall court.</p>

<p>Ministers are ordained by the people and no injunction to be
put upon any church officer or member, in point of doctrine,
worship or discipline, whether for substance or circumstance,
besides the institution of the Lord.</p>

<p>Whoever shall observe christmasse day or the like festivity,
by forbearing to labour, feasting or other way shall pay 5s.
and whosoever shall not resort to their meeting upon the
Lord's day and such days of fasting and Thanksgiving as shall
be appointed by authority, shall pay 5<i>s.</i> no days commanded
by the lawes of England to be observed or regarded.</p>

<p>No person shall be impressed or compelled to serve in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
wars but such as shall be enterprized by that commonwealth,
by the consent of a generall court, or by authority derived
from them.</p>

<p>No person whatsoever shall joine any persons in marriage
but a magistrate, it being an honorable ordinance and therefore
should be accordingly sollemnized.</p>

<p>All strangers professing the true christian religion that
shall fly to them for succour from the tyranny or oppression
of their persecutors, or for any necessary or compulsory cause,
they shall be entertained and protected amongst them according
to that power and prudence God shall give them. By
which law Whalley and Gosse and other traytors were kindly
receaved and entertained by Mr. Godkins and other magistrates.</p>

<p>Whosoever shall be in the possession of any land 5 years,
altho' the grant of said land was to another, and the possessor
have nothing to shew for the alienation thereof but his
possession, the possessor shall have the land confirmed to him.</p>

<p>No oath shall be urged or required to be taken by any
person but such oath as the generall court hath considered
allowed and required.</p>

<p>The oaths of allegiance and supremacy are neither taken by
the magistrates nor required to be taken by the inhabitants,
only an oath of fidelity to the government is imposed upon all
persons as well strangers as inhabitants, upon the penalty of
5<i>l.</i> for every week they shall refuse the said oath.</p>

<p><i>Acts and Resolves of the Province of Massachusetts Bay</i>, I, 1-20.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The stubborn persistence of Massachusetts in resisting all regulation
from England finally involved all New England in the despotic rule of
Andros. On the overthrow of Andros (on the flight of James II and the
accession of William III), Connecticut and Rhode Island continued
their former charter governments; but the Massachusetts Charter of
1629 had been declared void by the English courts and had been formally
surrendered. The best Massachusetts could now do was to secure a
much more limited instrument. For a fuller history, cf. <i>American

<h4>111. Attempts by England at Closer Control after 1700</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For an outline of these natural and long-continued attempts, see <i>American
History and Government</i>, &sect;&sect; 117, 118. The first attempt, barely avoided
and only by accident, is given under <i>a</i>, below; <i>b</i> represents American
feeling toward such encroachments; and <i>c</i> illustrates the activity of a
New England town meeting in this field of <i>general</i> politics.</p></div>


<h5><i>a. Recommendation from the Board of Trade to make
all the Colonies into Royal Provinces. March 26/Apr.
5, 1701</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>North Carolina Colonial Records</i>, I, 535.</p></div>

<p class="center"><i>To the King's most Excellent Majestie.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>May it please, etc.</i></p>

<p>Having formerly on severall occasions humbly represented
to your Majesty the state of the Government under Proprietors
and Charters in America; and perceiving the irregularities of
these Governments dayly to increase, to the prejudice of Trade
and of your Majesties other Plantations in America, as well as
of your Majesties revenue arising from the Customes here, we
find ourselves obliged at present humbly to represent to your
Majesty;</p>

<p>That those Colonies in general have no ways answered the
chief design for which such large Tracts of Land and such
Priviledges and Immunities were granted by the Crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>That they have not conformed themselves to the severall
acts of Parliament for regulating Trade and Navigation, to
which they ought to pay the same obedience, and submit to
the same Restrictions as the other Plantations, which are
subject to your Majesties immediate Government; on the
contrary in most of these Proprieties and Charter Governments,
the Governours have not applyed themselves to your
Majesty for your approbation, nor have taken the Oaths required
by the acts of Trade, both which Qualifications are
made necessary by the late Act for preventing frauds and
regulating abuses in the Plantation Trade.</p>

<p>That they have assumed to themselves a power to make
Laws contrary and repugnant to the Laws of England, and
directly prejudicial to Trade, some of them having refused to
send hither such Laws as they had enacted, and others having
sent them but very imperfectly.</p>

<p>That diverse of them have denyed appeals to your Majesty
in Councill, by which not only the Inhabitants of those Colonies
but others your Majesties subjects are deprived of that
benefit, enjoyed in the Plantations, under your Majesties immediate
Government, and the parties agrieved are left without
remedy from the arbitrary and Illegal proceedings of their
Courts.</p>

<p>That these Colonies continue to be the refuge and retreat
of Pirates and Illegal Traders, and the receptacle of Goods
imported thither from foreign parts contrary to Law: In
return of which Commodities those of the growth of these
Colonies are likewise contrary to Law exported to Foreign
parts; All which is likewise much incouraged by their not
admitting appeals as aforesaide.</p>

<p>That by raising and lowering their coin from time to time,
to their particular advantage, and to the prejudice of other
Colonies, By exempting their Inhabitants from Duties and
Customes to which the other Colonies are subject, and by
Harbouring of Servants and fugitives, these Governments
tend greatly to the undermining the Trade and Welfare of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
other Plantations, and seduce and draw away the People
thereof; By which Diminution of Hands the rest of the
Colonies more beneficial to England do very much suffer.</p>

<p>That these Independent Colonies do turn the Course of
Trade to the Promoting and proprogating woolen and other
Manufactures proper to England, instead of applying their
thoughts and Endeavours to the production of such commodities
as are fit to be encouraged in these parts according to
the true design and intention of such settlements.</p>

<p>That they do not in general take any due care for their own
defence and security against an Enemy, either in Building
Forts or providing their Inhabitants with sufficient Armes
and Amunition, in case they should be attacked, which is
every day more and more to be apprehended, considering how
the French power encreases in those parts.</p>

<p>That this cheifly arises from the ill use they make of the
powers entrusted to them by their Charters, and the Independency
which they pretend to, and that each Government is
obliged only to defend its self without any consideration had
of their Neighbours, or of the general preservation of the whole.</p>

<p>That many of them have not a regular militia and some
(particularly the Colonies of East and West New Jersey) are
no otherwise at present than in a state of Anarchy and
confusion.</p>

<p><i>And because the care of these and other great mischiefs in your
Majesties Plantations and Colonies aforesaid, and the introducing
such an administration of Government and fit regulation of
Trade as may put them into a better State of Security and make
them duly subservient and usefull to England, does every day
become more and more necessary, and that your Majesties frequent
Commands to them have not met with due complyance:
We humbly conceive it may be expedient that the Charters of the
severall Proprietors and others intitling them to absolute Government
be reassumed to the Crown and these Colonies put into the
same State and dependency as those of your Majesties other
Plantations, without prejudice to any man's particular property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
and freehold. Which being no otherwise so well to be effected
as by the Legislative power of this Kingdome.</i></p>

<p>Wee humbly submit the same to your Majesties Royal
consideration.</p>


<h5><i>b. John Wise upon Englishmen and Tyranny</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This extract comes from a pamphlet by John Wise, minister at
Ipswich, and a leader (and sufferer) against arbitrary taxation by
Andros twenty years earlier, and is in the nature of a warning that the
American English will not submit to political aggression.</p></div>

<p>Englishmen hate an arbitrary power (politically considered)
as they hate the devil. ... And though many of their incautelous
princes have endeavored to null all their charter
rights and immunities, and agrandize themselves in the servile
state of the subjects, by setting up their own seperate will,
for the great standard of government over the nation, yet
they have all along paid dear for their attempts, both in the
ruin of the nation, and in interrupting the increase of their
own grandeur, and their foreign settlements and conquests.</p>

<p>Had the late reigns, before the accession of the great
<i>William</i> and <i>Mary</i>, to the throne of England, but taken the
measures of them, and [of] her present majesty,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> in depressing
vice, and advancing the union and wealth, and encouraging the
prowice and bravery of the nation, they might by this time
have been capable to have given laws to any monarch on
earth; but spending their time in the pursuit of an absolute
monarchy (contrary to the temper of the nation, and the ancient
constitution of the government) through all the
meanders of state craft: It has apparently kept back the
glory, and dampt all the most noble affairs of the nation.
And when under the midwifry of <i>Machiavilan</i> art, and cunning
of a daring prince, this <span class="smcap">Monster</span>, tyranny, and arbitrary
government, was at last just born, upon the holding up of a
finger! or upon the least signal given, ON the whole nation
goes upon this HYDRA.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>The very name of an arbitrary government is ready to put
an Englishman's blood into a fermentation; but when it really
comes, and shakes its whip over their ears, and tells them it
is their master, it makes them stark mad.</p>

<h5><i>d. Connecticut refuses to obey a Royal Officer appointed
to command her Militia against French and Indians
in 1693</i></h5>

<p><i>New York Colonial Documents</i>, IV, 71.</p>

<p>King William III appointed Fletcher governor of the royal province of
New York, and commissioned him to command the militia also of Connecticut,
the neighboring charter colony, in the war usually known as
King William's War. The device was eminently wise, as a military measure;
but it was stubbornly resisted by Connecticut. The historians of
that colony delight to tell a legend that when the governor arrived and
tried to have his commission read by his secretary to the militia (drawn
up in arms to repel rather than to receive him), Captain Wadsworth
drowned the reading by commanding drums to beat; three times this
was repeated; and the last time Wadsworth added, "If you try again,
I'll make daylight shine through you." The following document gives
what is probably a more accurate statement,&mdash;but one which shows
equally well that Connecticut had her way. For the general conflict of
which this was one incident between crown and colonies, cf. <i>American
History and Government</i>, &sect;&sect; 117, 118.</p>

Committee on the Colonies urging that the Connecticut Charter be proceeded
against under a writ of quo warranto, with a view of uniting that
colony with New York. The same letter describes in detail the serious
perils from French and Indians. One paragraph should be quoted: "Our
hardships grow upon us. Canada ... hath received seven hundred men
and stores of Warr from France this last Summer. Our Indians falter
... <i>These small Colonies ... are [as] much divided in theire interest

<h4>113. Free Speech Vindicated</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Trial of John Peter Zenger, 1735.</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Zenger, in 1738, published a "Brief Narrative of the Case and Tryall,"
somewhat in the form of a modern "Report," though he speaks in the
first person. In 1735 the governor of New York removed the chief
justice of the colony for personal reasons. Zenger, in his <i>Weekly Journal</i>,
vigorously criticized this and <i>other despotic</i> actions of the governor. He
was prosecuted for criminal libel; and the new chief justice showed a
determination to secure a conviction, trying to limit the jury to deciding
only whether Zenger was responsible for the publication, and reserving
to himself the decision whether the words were punishable. This was
the custom in English courts of the day in government prosecutions.</p>

<p>Italics and black-faced type are as in the original.</p></div>

<p>[The Attorney General's complaint, as Zenger reports, characterized
him as "a seditious person and a frequent Printer and
Publisher of false news and seditious Libels, and charged specifically
that he] "did falsely, seditiously, and scandalously print
and publish ... a certain false, malicious, seditious, scandalous
Libel ... concerning His Excellency the Governour ... [in
which publication he represented a former inhabitant explaining
that he had left the colony, as he doubts not others will, because,
among other reasons] They ... think ... that their LIBERTIES
and PROPERTIES are precarious, and that SLAVERY
is likely to be intailed on them and their Posterity if some past
Things be not amended ... (meaning, the past Proceedings of
his Excellency the Governor ...) ... [and] WE ... SEE
MENS DEEDS DESTROYED, JUDGES ARBITRARILY
DISPLACED, NEW COURTS ERECTED WITHOUT
CONSENT OF THE LEGISLATURE....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Who then [can] call any Thing his own, or enjoy any Liberty
... longer than those in the Administration ... will condescend
to let them?</i>"</p>

<p>[This publication, the Attorney General charges, was] to the
great disturbance of the Peace of the ... Province ... to the
Great Scandal of Our said Lord the King, of His Excellency
the Governor [etc]; whereupon the said Attorney General of
Our said Lord the King, for Our said Lord the King, prays
... the due Process of the Law against him the said <i>John
Peter Zenger</i> ... in the Premises.</p>

<p>[The Report continues:]</p>

<p>To this Information the Defendant has pleaded <i>Not Guilty</i>,
and we are ready to prove it....</p>

<p>Then Mr. <i>Hamilton</i>,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> who at the Request of some of my
Friends, was so kind as to come from <i>Philadelphia</i> to assist me
on the Tryal, spoke.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Hamilton</i>, "May it please your Honour; I am concerned
in this Cause on the Part of Mr. <i>Zenger</i> the Defendant. The
Information against my Client was sent me, a few days before
I left Home, with some Instructions to let me know how far I
might rely upon the Truth of those Parts of the Papers set
forth in the Information, and which are said to be libellous
... I cannot think it proper for me (without doing Violence
to my own Principles) to deny the Publication of a Complaint,
which I think is the Right of every free-born Subject to make,
when the Matters so published can be supported with Truth;
and therefore I'll save Mr. Attorney the Trouble of Examining
his Witnesses to that Point; and I do (for my Client) confess,
that he both printed and published the two News Papers set
forth in the Information, and I hope in so doing he has committed
no Crime. ..."</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Attorney</i>, ... "The Case before the Court is, whether
Mr. <i>Zenger</i> is guilty of Libelling his Excellency the Governor
of <i>New-York</i>, and indeed the whole administration of the Gov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>ernment?
Mr. <i>Hamilton</i> has confessed the Printing and Publishing,
and I think nothing is plainer, than that the Words in
the Information are <b><i>scandalous, and tend to Sedition, and to disquiet
the Minds of the People of this Province</i></b>. And if such Papers are
not Libels, I think it may be said, there can be no such Thing
as a Libel."</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Hamilton</i>, "May it please your Honour; I cannot agree
with Mr. Attorney: For tho' I freely acknowledge, that there
are such Things as Libels, yet I must insist at the same Time,
that what my Client is charged with, is not a Libel; and I
observed just now, that Mr. Attorney in defining a Libel, made
use of the Words <b><i>scandalous, seditious, and tend to disquiet the People</i></b>;
but (whether with Design or not I will not say) he omitted
the Word <b><i>false</i></b>."</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Attorney</i>, I think I did not omit the Word <b><i>false</i></b>: But it
has been said already, that it may be a Libel, notwithstanding
it may be true.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Hamilton</i>, In this I must still differ with Mr. Attorney;
for I depend upon it, we are to be tried upon this Information
now before the Court and Jury, and to which we have pleaded
<b><i>Not Guilty</i></b>, and by it we are charged with printing and publishing,
<b><i>a certain false, malicious, seditious and scandalous Libel</i></b>. This
Word <b><i>false</i></b> must have some Meaning, or else how came it
there?...</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ch. Justice</i>, You cannot be admitted, Mr. <b><i>Hamilton</i></b>, to give
the Truth of a Libel in Evidence. A Libel is not to be justified;
for it is nevertheless a Libel that [i.e. tho'] it is <b><i>true</i></b>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Hamilton</i>, I am sorry the court has so soon resolved upon
that Piece of Law; I expected first to have been heard to that
Point. I have not in all my Reading met with an Authority
that says, we cannot be admitted to give the Truth in
Evidence, upon an Information for a Libel.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ch. Justice</i>, The Law is clear, That you cannot justify a
Libel....</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Hamilton</i>, I thank your Honour. Then, Gentlemen of the
Jury, it is to you we must now appeal, for Witnesses, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
Truth of the Facts we have offered, and are denied the Liberty
to prove; and let it not seem strange, that I apply my self to
you in this Manner, I am warranted so to do both by Law and
Reason. The Last supposes you to be summones, <i>out of the
Neighbourhood where the Fact is alledged to be committed</i>; and
the Reason of your being taken out of the Neighbourhood is,
<i>because you are supposed to have the best Knowledge of the Fact
that is to be tried</i>. And were you to find a Verdict against my
Client, you must take upon you to say, the Papers referred to
in the Information, and which we acknowledge we printed and
published, are, <i>false, scandalous and seditious</i>; but of this I can
have no Apprehension. You are Citizens of <i>New-York</i>; you
are really what the Law supposes you to be, <i>honest and lawful
Men</i>; and, according to my Brief, the Facts which we offer to
prove were not committed in a Corner; they are notoriously
known to be true; and therefore in your Justice lies our Safety.
And as we are denied the Liberty of giving Evidence, to prove
the Truth of what we have published, I will beg Leave to lay
it down as a Standing Rule in such Cases, <i>That the suppressing
of Evidence ought always to be taken for the strongest Evidence</i>;
and I hope it will have that Weight with you....</p>

<p>... It is true in Times past it was a Crime to speak Truth,
and in that terrible Court of Star-Chamber, many worthy and
brave Men suffred for so doing; and yet even in that Court,
and in those bad Times, a great and good Man durst say, what
I hope will not be taken amiss of me to say in this Place, <i>to
wit, the Practice of Informations for Libels is a Sword in the
Hands of a wicked king and</i> [of] <i>an arrand Coward to cut down
and destroy the innocent; the one cannot, because of his high
station, and the other dares not, because of his Want of Courage,
revenge himself in another Manner.</i></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Attorney</i>, Pray Mr. <i>Hamilton</i>, have a Care what you
say, don't go too far neither, I don't like those Liberties.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Hamilton</i>, Sure, Mr. Attorney, you won't make any
Applications; all Men agree that we are governed by the best
of Kings, and I cannot see the Meaning of Mr. Attorney's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
Caution. ... May it please Your Honour, I was saying, That
notwithstanding all the Duty and Reverence claimed by Mr.
Attorney to Men in Authority, they are not exempt from
observing the Rules of common Justice, either in their private
or publick Capacities; the Laws of our Mother Country know
no Exception....</p>

<p>I hope to be pardon'd, Sir, for my Zeal upon this Occasion:
It is an old and wise Caution, <i>That when our Neighbour's House
is on Fire, We ought to take Care of our own</i>. For tho', blessed
be God, I live in a Government where Liberty is well understood,
and freely enjoy'd; yet Experience has shewn us all
(I'm sure it has to me) that a bad Precedent in one Government,
is soon set up for an Authority in another; and therefore
I cannot but think it mine, and every Honest Man's Duty,
that (while we pay all due Obedience to Men in Authority)
we ought at the same Time to be upon our Guard against
Power [i.e., arbitrary power], wherever we apprehend that it
may effect Ourselves or our Fellow-Subjects.</p>

<p>I am truly very unequal to such an Undertaking on many
Accounts. And you see I labour under the Weight of many
Years, and am born down with great Infirmities of Body; yet
Old and Weak as I am, I should think it my Duty, if required,
to go to the utmost Part of the land, where my Service cou'd
be of any Use in assisting to quench the flame of Prosecutions
upon Informations, set on Foot by the Government, to deprive
a People of the Right of Remonstrating (and complaining
too) of the arbitrary Attempts of Men in Power. Men who
injure and oppress the People under their Administration
provoke them to cry out and complain; and then make that
very Complaint the foundation for new Oppressions and Prosecutions.
... But to conclude; the Question before the Court
and you, Gentlemen of the Jury, is not of small nor private
Concern, it is not the Cause of a poor Printer, nor of <i>New-York</i>
alone, which you are now trying; No! It may in its
Consequence, affect every Freeman that lives under a British
Government on the Main of <i>America</i>. It is the best Cause.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
It is the Cause of Liberty; and I make no Doubt but your
upright Conduct, this Day, will not only entitle you to the
Love and Esteem of your Fellow-Citizens; but every Man,
who prefers Freedom to a Life of Slavery, will bless and
honour You, as Men who have baffled the Attempt of Tyranny;
and by an impartial and uncorrupt Verdict, have laid a noble
Foundation for Securing to ourselves, our Posterity, and our
Neighbours, That to which Nature and the Laws of our
Country have given us a Right,&mdash;the Liberty&mdash;both of exposing
and opposing arbitrary Power (in these Parts of the
World, at least) by speaking and writing Truth....</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ch. Just.</i> Gentlemen of the Jury. The great pains
Mr. <i>Hamilton</i> has taken, to shew how little Regard Juries are
to Pay to the Opinion of the Judges; and his insisting so
much upon the Conduct of some Judges in Tryals of this
kind; is done, no doubt, with a Design that you should take
but very little Notice of what I may say upon this Occasion.
I shall therefore only observe to you that, as the Facts or
Words in the Information are confessed: The only Thing that
can come in Question before you is, Whether the Words, as
set forth in the Information, make a Libel. And that is a
Matter of Law, no doubt, and which you may leave to the
Court. But I shall trouble you no further with any Thing
more of my own, but read to you the Words of a learned and
upright Judge in a Case of the like Nature.</p>

<h4>114. Franklin's "Albany Plan," July 10, 1754<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the eve of the French and Indian War, in June 19, 1754, there met
at Albany, on the call of the Lords of Trade, a colonial congress to agree
upon measures of defense. Seven colonies were represented,&mdash;New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania,
and Maryland,&mdash;none south of the Potomac. Massachusetts
had authorized her commissioners to "enter into articles of union and
confederation" with the other colonies "as well in time of peace as
of war." On the sixth day of the session, the Congress voted unanimously
that a union of all the colonies was "absolutely necessary
for their security." A committee, representing each of the colonies
present, was created to consider various plans, and, after almost daily
discussions, a general plan was accepted on July 9. Franklin was
appointed to draft the detailed plan,&mdash;and, the next day, a form submitted
by him was adopted. Franklin afterward said of the result: "the
Fate of this Plan was singular ... The Crown disapproved it, as having
too much Weight in the Democratic Part of the Constitution; and every
Assembly, as having allowed too much to Prerogative. So it was totally
rejected."</p>

<p>The text of a number of other plans for colonial federation, between
1696 and 1754, are collected in No. 14 of the <i>American History Leaflets</i>.</p></div>

<p>The following extract is part of the "introduction" to the Plan afterward
drawn up by Franklin and printed in his <i>Works</i> (Smyth edition, III, 203-204).</p></div>

<p>The commissioners from a number of the northern colonies,
being met at Albany, and considering the difficulties that have
always attended the most necessary general measures for the
common defence, or for the annoyance of the enemy, when
they were to be carried through the several particular Assemblies
of all the colonies; some Assemblies being before at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
variance with their governors or councils, and the several
branches of the government not on terms of doing business
with each other: others taking the opportunity, when their
concurrence is wanted, to push for favorite laws, powers, or
points, that they think could not at other times be obtained,
and so creating disputes and quarrels; one Assembly waiting
to see what another will do, being afraid of doing more than
its share, or desirous of doing less, or refusing to do anything
because its country is not at present so much exposed as
others, or because another will reap more immediate advantage;
from one or other of which causes, the Assemblies of
six out of seven colonies applied to, had granted no assistance
to Virginia when lately invaded by the French, though purposely
convened, and the importance of the occasion earnestly
urged upon them;&mdash;considering moreover, that one principal
encouragement to the French, in invading and insulting the
British American dominions, was their knowledge of our disunited
state, and of our weakness arising from such want of
union; and that from hence different colonies were, at different
times, extremely harassed, and put to great expense
both of blood and treasure, who would have remained in
peace, if the enemy had had cause to fear the drawing on
themselves the resentment and power of the whole;&mdash;the
said commissioners, considering also the present encroachments
of the French, and the mischievous consequences that
may be expected from them, if not opposed with our [united]
force, came to an unanimous resolution; <i>That a union of the
colonies is absolutely necessary for their preservation</i>.</p>

<p>[In 1789 Franklin wrote, with good reason, that the adoption of the
Albany Plan would have probably delayed the separation of the colonies
from England, "perhaps during another century." There would have
been a central legislature to vote supplies and prepare defense against
Indians and French, and the British reasons for the Stamp Act would
not have existed.]</p></div>

III, 208 ff.), he adds to this section: " ... it being proposed by the gentlemen
of the Council of New York ... to alter the plan in this particular,
and <i>to give the governors and council</i> of the several provinces a share in the
choice of the grand council [or at least a veto upon the selections], it was
said,....</p>
<p>"That it is essential to English liberty, that the subject should not be
taxed but by his own consent, or the consent of his elected representatives.</p>
<p>"That taxes to be laid and levied by this proposed constitution will be
proposed and agreed to by the representatives of the people, if the plan in
this particular be preserved.</p>
<p>"But if the proposed alteration should take place, it seemed as if matters
may be so managed as that the crown shall finally have the appointment, not
only of the president-general, but of a majority of the grand Council....</p>
<p>"And so the people in all the colonies would in effect be taxed by their
governors.</p>
<p>[Some three pages more of like argument.]</p>
<p>"Upon the whole the commissioners were of opinion that the choice was
most properly placed in the representatives of the people."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_116" id="Footnote_116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116"><span class="label">[116]</span></a> Franklin's comment was (see note above): "Governors have sometimes
wantonly exercised the power of ... continuing the sessions of Assemblies,
merely to harass the members and compel a compliance; and sometimes dissolve
them on slight disgusts." This provision may have been suggested to
Franklin by the fact that in his own colony the legislative sittings were
independent of the governor's will (No. 103, <i>b</i>, above).</p></div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Persons</span> in a state of servitude are under four distinct denominations:
negroes, who are the entire property of their
respective owners: convicts, who are transported from the
mother country for a limited term: indented servants, who are
engaged for five years previous to their leaving England;
and free-willers, who are supposed, from their situation,
to possess superior advantages....</p>

<p>Persons convicted of felony, and in consequence transported
to this continent, if they are able to pay the expense of passage,
are free to pursue their fortune agreeably to their inclinations
or abilities. Few, however, have means to avail themselves of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>this advantage. These unhappy beings are, generally, consigned
to an agent, who classes them suitably to their real
or supposed qualifications; advertises them for sale, and
disposes of them, for seven years, to planters, to mechanics,
and to such as choose to retain them for domestic service.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The generality of the inhabitants in this province are very
little acquainted with those fallacious pretences, by which
numbers are continually induced to embark for this continent.
On the contrary, they too generally conceive an opinion that
the difference is merely nominal between the indented servant
and the convicted felon: nor will they readily believe
that people, who had the least experience in life, and whose
characters were unexceptionable, would abandon their friends
and families, and their ancient connexions, for a servile situation,
in a remote appendage to the British Empire. From
this persuasion they rather consider the convict as the more
profitable servant, his term being for seven, the latter only
for five years; and, I am sorry to observe, that there are but
few instances wherein they experience different treatment.
Negroes being a property for life, the death of slaves, in the
prime of youth or strength, is a material loss to the proprietor;
they are, therefore, almost in every instance, under more
comfortable circumstances than the miserable European, over
whom the rigid planter exercises an inflexible severity.
They [white servants] are strained to the utmost to perform
their allotted labour....</p>

<p>The situation of the free-willer is, in almost every instance
more to be lamented than either that of the convict or the
indented servant; the deception which is practised on those
of this description being attended with circumstances of greater
duplicity and cruelty. ... They are told, that their services
will be eagerly solicited, in proportion to their abilities; that their
reward will be adequate to the hazard they encounter by courting
fortune in a distant region; and that the parties with whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
they engage will readily advance the sum agreed on for their
passage; which, being averaged at about nine pounds sterling,
they will speedily be enabled to repay, and to enjoy, in a state
of liberty, a comparative situation of ease and affluence. ...
It is, therefore, an article of agreement with these deluded
victims, that if they are not successful in obtaining situations,
on their own terms, within a certain number of days after their
arrival in the country, they are then to be sold, in order to
defray the charges of passage....</p>

and May 29 the last of the others was expunged from the record. The
full text was published by newspapers, however, and it was generally
supposed that Virginia had approved them all as here given.</p></div>

<p><i>Whereas</i>, The Honorable House of Commons, in <i>England</i>,
have of late drawn into question how far the General Assembly
of this colony hath power to enact laws for laying of taxes
and imposing duties payable by the people of this, his Majesty's
most ancient colony; for settling and ascertaining the
same to all future times, the House of Burgesses of this
present General Assembly have come to the following resolves.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the first adventurers, settlers of this his
Majesty's colony and dominion of <i>Virginia</i>, brought with
them and transmitted to their posterity, and all other his
Majesty's subjects, since inhabiting in this his Majesty's
colony, all the privileges and immunities that have at any
time been held, enjoyed, and possessed by the people of <i>Great
Britain</i>.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That by two royal charters, granted by King
<i>James</i> the First, the colony aforesaid are declared and entitled
to all privileges, and immunities of natural born subjects, to
all intents and purposes as if they had been abiding an born
within the realm of <i>England</i>.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That his Majesty's liege people of this ancient
colony have enjoyed the right of being thus governed by their
own Assembly in the article of taxes and internal police,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
and that the same have never been forfeited, or any other
way yielded up, but have been constantly recognized by the
King and people of <i>Great Britain</i>.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, Therefore, that the General Assembly of this
colony, together with his Majesty or his substitutes, have, in
their representative capacity, the only exclusive right and
power to lay taxes and imposts upon the inhabitants of this
colony; and that every attempt to vest such power in any
other person or persons whatever than the General Assembly
aforesaid, is illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust, and has a
manifest tendency to destroy <i>British</i> as well as <i>American</i>
liberty.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That his Majesty's liege people, the inhabitants
of this colony, are not bound to yield obedience to any law
or ordinance whatever, designed to impose any taxation whatsoever
upon them, other than the laws or ordinances of the
General Assembly aforesaid.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That any person who shall, by speaking or writing,
assert or maintain that any person or persons, other than the
General Assembly of this colony, have any right or power
to impose or lay any taxation on the people here, shall be
deemed an enemy to his Majesty's colony.</p>

the firmest ties that religion and virtue can frame, most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
sacredly and punctually to stand by, and with our lives and
fortunes, to support, maintain, and defend each other in the
observance and execution of these following articles....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> As the Stamp Act does absolutely direct the
property of the people to be taken from them without their
consent expressed by their representatives, and as in many
cases it deprives the <i>British American</i> subject of his right to
trial by jury; we do determine, at every hazard, and, paying
no regard to danger or to death, we will exert every faculty, to
prevent the execution of the said Stamp Act in any instance
whatsoever within this Colony. And every abandoned wretch,
who shall be so lost to virtue and public good, as wickedly to
contribute to the introduction or fixture of the Stamp Act in
this Colony, by using stampt paper, or by any other means,
we will, with the utmost expedition, convince all such profligates
that immediate danger shall attend their prostitute
purpose.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly.</i> That the last article may most surely and effectually
be executed, we engage to each other, that whenever it
shall be known to any of this association, that any person is so
conducting himself as to favor the introduction of the Stamp
Act, that immediate notice shall be given to as many of the
association as possible; and that every individual so informed,
shall, with expedition, repair to a place of meeting to be
appointed as near the scene of action as may be....</p>

<p><i>Sixthly.</i> If any attempt shall be made on the liberty or
property of any associator for any action or thing to be done
in consequence of this engagement, we do most solemnly bind
ourselves by the sacred engagements above entered into, at the
utmost risk of our lives and fortunes, to restore such associate
to his liberty, and to protect him in the enjoyment of his
property....</p>

<h5><i>c. Resignation of Stamp Distributor in Virginia, 1765
(Letter of the Governor to the Lords of Trade)</i></h5>

<p>The present unhappy state of this Colony, will, to my great
concern, oblige me to trouble Your Lordships with a long and
very disagreeable letter. We were for some time in almost
daily expectations of the arrival of Colonel Mercer with the
Stamps for the use of this Colony, and rumours were industriously
thrown out that at the time of the General Court parties
would come down from most parts of the country to seize on
and destroy all Stamped Papers....</p>

<p>Very unluckily, Colonel Mercer arrived at the time this town
was the fullest of Strangers. On Wednesday the 30th October
he came up to town. I then thought proper to go to the
Coffee house ... that I might be an eye witness of what did
really pass, and not receive it by relation from others. The
mercantile people were all assembled as usual. The first word
I heard was "One and all"; upon which, as at a word agreed
on before between themselves, they all quitted the place to
find Colonel Mercer at his Father's lodgings where it was known
he was. This concourse of people I should call a mob, did I
not know that <i>it was chiefly if not altogether composed of gentlemen
of property</i> in the Colony, some of them at the head of their respective
Counties, <i>and the merchants of the country</i>, whether English,
Scotch or Virginian; for few absented themselves. They
met Colonel Mercer on the way, just at the Capitol: there they
stopped and demanded of him an answer whether he would
resign or act in this office as Distributor of the Stamps. He
said it was an affair of great moment to him; he must consult
his friends; and promised to give them an answer at 10 o'clock
on Friday morning at that place. This did not satisfy them;
and they followed him to the Coffee house, in the porch of
which I had seated myself with many of the Council and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
Speaker, who had posted himself between the crowd and myself.
We all received him with the greatest marks of welcome;
with which, if one may be allowed to judge by their countenances,
they [the "mob"] were not well pleased, tho' they remained
quiet and were silent. Now and then a voice was
heard from the crowd that Friday was too late; the Act would
take place, they would have an answer tomorrow. Several
messages were brought to Mr. Mercer by the leading men of the
crowd, to whom he constantly answered he had already given an
answer and he would have no other extorted from him. After
some little time a cry was heard, "let us rush in." Upon this
we that were at the top of the [steps], knowing the advantage
our situation gave us to repell those who should attempt to mount
them, advanced to the edge of the Steps, of which number I was
one. I immediately heard a cry, "See the Governor, take care
of him." Those who before were pushing up the steps, immediately
fell back, and left a small space between me and them.
If your Lordships will not accuse me of vanity I would say
that I believe this to be partly owing to the respect they bore
to my character and partly to the love they bore to my person.
After much entreaty of some of his friends, Mr. Mercer was,
against his own inclination, prevailed upon to promise them an
answer at the Capitol the next evening at five. The crowd did
not yet disperse; it was growing dark, and I did not think it
safe to have to leave Mr. Mercer behind me, so I again advanced
to the edge of the steps and said aloud I believed no man there
would do me any hurt, and turned to Mr. Mercer and told him
if he would walk with me through the people I believed I
could conduct him safe to my house; and we accordingly
walked side by side through the thickest of the people, who
did not molest us, tho' there was some little murmurs. By me
thus taking him under my protection, I believe I saved him
from being insulted at least. When we got home we had much
discourse on the subject. ... He left me that night in a state
of uncertainty what part he should act.</p>

<p>Accordingly Mr. Mercer appeared at the Capitol at 5, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
had promised. The number of people assembled there was
much increased, by messengers having been sent into the
neighborhood for that purpose. Colonel Mercer then read to
them the answer which is printed in the Supplement of the
Gazette, of which I enclose your Lordships a copy, to which I
beg leave to refer.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>...</p>

<p>[Mercer offered to resign his commission to the governor&mdash;who
refused to accept the resignation.] If I accepted the resignation,
I must appoint another, and I was well convinced I
could not find one to accept of it, in those circumstances,
which would render the office cheap. Besides if I left Mr.
Mercer in possession of the place he would be always ready to
distribute the Stamped papers, whenever peoples eyes should
be opened and they should come to their senses, so as to receive
them....</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Francis Fauquier.</span></p>

<p>Colonel Mercer has informed me that he proposes to apply
to the Commanders of His Majesty's ships of War, to take the
Stamped Papers on board their ships for His Majesty's, service:
it being the place of the greatest if not the only security for
them: for I am convinced, as well as himself, that it would be
extremely dangerous to attempt to land them during the present
fermented state of the Colony. If these Gentlemen should
refuse to take charge of them, and Mr. Mercer should apply
to me, I will do my duty to His Majesty and save them from
being destroyed, to the best of my power, tho' I can by no
means answer for the success of my endeavors....</p>

<p class="center">I am with the greatest respect and esteem, my Lords</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">Your Lordships most obedient</span><br />

apprehending and punishing all those who shall dare to engage
in any treasonable Practices against your Majesty, or disturb
the Tranquility of Government, we cannot, without Horror,
think of the new, unusual, and permit us, with all Humility,
to add, unconstitutional and illegal Mode, recommended to your
Majesty, of seizing and carrying beyond the Sea, the Inhabitants
of America, suspected of any Crime; and of trying such
Persons in any other Manner than by the ancient and long established
Course of Proceeding: For how truly deplorable
must be the Case of a wretched American, who, having incurred
the Displeasure of any one in Power, is dragged from his native
Home, and his dearest domestick Connections, thrown
into Prison, not to await his Trial before a Court, Jury, or
Judges, from a Knowledge of whom he is encouraged to hope
for speedy Justice; but to exchange his Imprisonment in his
own Country, for Fetters amongst Strangers? Conveyed to a
distant Land, where no Friend, no Relation, will alleviate his
Distresses, or minister to his Necessities; and where no Witness
can be found to testify his Innocence; shunned by the
reputable and honest, and consigned to the Society and Converse
of the wretched and the abandoned; he can only pray

<p class="center">Williamsburg
                    Wednesday, the 17th May. 1769.</p>

<p>About 12 o'Clock his Excellency the Governor was pleased,
by his Messenger, to command the Attendance of the House
of Burgesses in the Council Chamber, whereupon, in Obedience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
to his Lordship's Command, the House, with their Speaker,
immediately waited upon his Excellency, when he thought fit
to dissolve the General Assembly.</p>

<p>The late Representatives of the People then judging it
necessary that some Measures should be taken in their distressed
Situation, for preserving the true and essential Interests
of the Colony, resolved upon a Meeting for that very
salutary Purpose, and therefore, immediately, with the greatest
Order and Decorum, repaired to the House of Mr. Anthony
Hay in this City, where being assembled, it was first proposed,
for the more decent and regular Discussion of such Matters as
might be taken into Consideration, that a Moderator should be
appointed, and, on the Question being put, Peyton Randolph,
Esq; <i>late Speaker of the House of Burgesses</i>, was unanimously
elected.</p>

<p>The true state of the Colony, being then opened and fully
explained, and it being proposed that a regular Association
should be formed, a Committee was appointed to prepare the
necessary and most proper Regulations for that Purpose, and
they were ordered to make their Report to the General Meeting
the next Day at 10 o'clock.</p>

<p class="center">Thursday. May 18.</p>

<p>At a farther Meeting, according to Adjournment, the Committee
appointed Yesterday, made their Report, which being
read, seriously considered and approved, was signed by a
great Number of the Principal Gentlemen of the Colony then
present, and is as follows:</p>

<p>We his Majesty's most dutiful Subjects, the late Representatives
of all the Freeholders of the Colony of Virginia, avowing
our inviolable and unshaken Fidelity and Loyalty to our
most gracious Sovereign, our Affection for all our Fellow
Subjects of Great Britain protesting against every Act or
Thing which may have the most distant Tendancy to interrupt,
or in any wise disturb his Majesty's Peace, and the
good Order of his Government in this Colony, which we are
resolved, at the Risque of our Lives and Fortune, to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
and defend; but at the same Time, being deeply affected with
the Grievances and Distresses with which his Majesty's American
Subjects are oppressed, and dreading the Evils which
threaten the ruin of ourselves and our posterity, by reducing
us from a free and happy People, to a wretched and miserable
State of Slavery; and having taken into our most serious
Consideration the present State of the Trade of this Colony,
and of the American Commerce in general, observe with
Anxiety, that the Debt due Great Britain for Goods imported
from thence is very great, and that the Means of paying this
Debt, in the present Situation of Affairs, are likely to become
more and more precarious; that the Difficulties, under which
we now labour, are owing to Restrictions, Prohibitions, and ill
advised Regulations in several late Acts of Parliament of
Great Britain; in particular, that the late unconstitutional Act,
imposing Duties on Tea, Paper, Glass, etc., for the sole Purpose
of raising a Revenue in America, is injurious to Property;
and destructive to Liberty, hath a necessary Tendency to prevent
the Payment of the Debt due from this Colony to Great
Britain, and is, of Consequence, ruinous to Trade; that, notwithstanding
the many earnest Applications already made,
there is little reason to expect a Redress of those Grievances:
Therefore, in Justice to ourselves and our Posterity, as well as
to the Traders of Great Britain concerned in the American
Commerce, we, the Subscribers, have voluntarily and unanimously
entered into the following Resolutions, in Hopes that
our Example will induce the good People of this Colony to be
frugal in the Use and Consumption of British Manufactures,
and that the Merchants and Manufacturers of Great Britain
may, from Motives of Interest, Friendship, and Justice, be
engaged to exert themselves to obtain for us a Redress of
those Grievances, under which the Trade and Inhabitants of
America at present labour: We do therefore most earnestly
recommend this our Association to the serious inhabitants of
this Colony, in Hopes, that they will very readily and cordially
accede thereto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p><i>First</i>, It is UNANIMOUSLY agreed on and resolved
this 18th day of May, 1769, that the Subscribers, as well
by their own Example, as all other legal Ways and Means
in their Power, will promote and encourage Industry and
Frugality, and discourage all Manner of Luxury and Extravagance.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, That they will not at any Time hereafter, directly
or indirectly import, or cause to be imported, any Manner of
Goods, Merchandise, or Manufactures, which are, or shall
thereafter be taxed by Act of Parliament, for the Purpose of
raising a Revenue in <i>America</i> (except Paper, not exceeding
Eight Shillings Sterling per Reem, and except such Articles
only, as Orders have been already sent for) nor purchase any
such after the First Day of September next, of any Person
whatsoever, but that they will always consider such Taxation,
in every Respect, as an absolute Prohibition, and in
all future Orders, direct their Correspondents to ship them
no Goods whatever, taxed as aforesaid, except as is above
excepted. ...<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<h4>122. The Origin of Massachusetts Town-Committees of Correspondence,
1772</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Boston Town Records, 1770-1777</i> (Report of the Record Commissioners,
1887), pp. 90-93.</p>

<p>A Boston town meeting of October 28 had been concerned with the
report that "Stipends are affixed by order of the Crown to the offices of
the Judges of Superior Court." This action had been taken by the
British government to render the judges independent of the Assembly
and of public opinion in Massachusetts. The meeting had voted that "a
decent ... Application" be made to the governor asking for information
as to the truth of the report. The Governor's refusal appears
in the first part of the document. This crisis, and the refusal of Governor
Hutchinson (below) to permit the Assembly to meet, brought about the
organization of committees of correspondence. Cf. <i>American History
and Government</i>, &sect; 140.</p></div>

<p><i>Fryday October 30</i>, 10 O'Clock Before Noon, Met according
to Adjournment.</p>

<p>The Committee to present the Governor an Address Reported
the following answer which his Excellency delivered to them in
Writing&mdash;Viz&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i></p>

<p>It is by no means proper for me to lay before the
Inhabitants of any Town whatsoever in consequence of their
Votes and Proceedings in a Town Meeting any part of my
Correspondence as Governor of this Province or to acquaint
them whether I have or have not received any advice relating
to the public Affairs of the Government. This reason alone if
your Address to me had been in other respects unexceptionable,
would have been sufficient to restrain me from complying with
your desire&mdash;</p>

<p>I shall always be ready to gratify the Inhabitants of the
Town of Boston upon every regular Application to me on
business of public concernment to the Town as far as I shall
have it in my power consistent with fidelity to the trust which
his Majesty has reposed in me&mdash;</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">T. Hutchinson.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>The aforegoing answer, having been considered&mdash;It was
moved and the Question put&mdash;Whether application shall be
now made to his Excellency by the Town that he would be
pleased to permit the General Assembly to meet at the time to
which they stand prorogued, which passed in the Affermative
<i>Nem Con.</i>&mdash;It was then Voted, that</p>


<ul><li>The Honorable James Otis, Esq.</li>
<li>Mr. Samuel Adams</li>
<li>The Honorable Thomas Cushing, Esq.</li>
</ul>

<p>be a Committee to prepare a Petition to his Excellency for the
purpose aforesaid&mdash;</p>

<p>The Petition of a number of the Inhabitants&mdash;"That
another public School may be Established at the South part
of the Town," was read, and after debate had thereon&mdash;the
Question was put&mdash;Whether the Consideration of the same
shall be referred to March Meeting&mdash;Passed in the affermative.</p>

<p>The Committee appointed by the Town at a late Meeting to
consider what was proper to be done to prevent the ruin of
Beacon Hill, were desired to make Report as soon as may be.</p>

<p>Voted, that the Town Clerk be directed to lay the Original
Grant of Beacon Hill before the Town at their adjournment.</p>

<p>Upon a Motion made&mdash;Voted, that the Selectmen be added
to the Committee relative to Beacon Hill&mdash;</p>

<p>The Committee chosen to prepare a Petition to the Governor,
relative to the Meeting of the General Court&mdash;Reported the
following Draft&mdash;Viz&mdash;</p>

<p>The Petition of the Freeholders and other Inhabitants of
the Town of Boston legally Assembled by Adjournment in
Faneuil Hall on Fryday 30 of October 1772&mdash;</p>

<p>Humbly Sheweth&mdash;</p>

<p>That your Petitioners are still greatly alarmed at the Report
which has been prevalent of late Viz. That Stipends are
affixed to the Offices of the Judges of the Superior Court of
Judicature of this Province by Order of the Crown for their
support&mdash;</p>

<p>Such an Establishment is contrary not only to the plain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
obvious sense of the Charter of this Province but also some of
the fundamental Principles of the Common Law, to the benefit
of which all British Subjects, wherever dispersed throughout
the British Empire, are indubitably entitled&mdash;...</p>

<p>It is therefore their earnest and humble request that your
Excellency would be pleased to allow the General Assembly
to meet at the time to which they now stand prorogued; in
order that in that <i>Constitutional</i> Body, with whom it is to
enquire into Grievances and Redress them, the Joint Wisdom
of the Province may be employed, in deliberating and determining
on a matter so important and alarming&mdash;</p>

<p>The Town having considered the foregoing Draft of a Petition
to Governor Hutchinson&mdash;It was Voted, that the same
be accepted, <i>Nem. Con.</i> Also Voted, that [seven names] be a
Committee to present the Petition to his Excellency&mdash;</p>

<p>Voted, that this Meeting be Adjourned to Monday next 3.
O'Clock P.M.</p>

<p><i>Monday November 2d</i> 3. O'Clock P.M. Met According to
Adjournment.</p>

<p>The Committee appointed to present a Petition To his Excellency
the Governor of this Province, Reported and laid
before the Town the following Reply which his Excellency
had been pleased to deliver them in writing&mdash;Viz. [A firm
claim that the town-meeting was meddling with matters that
were beyond its province, and a refusal to call the Assembly.]</p>

<p>The foregoing Reply having been read several times and
duly considered; it was moved and the Question accordingly
put Whether the same be satisfactory to the Town; which
passed in the Negative <i>Nem. Con.</i> And thereupon&mdash;</p>

<p>Resolved as the Opinion of the Inhabitants of this Town
that they have ever had, and ought to have, a right to Petition
the King or his Representatives for the Redress of such
Grievances as they feel or for preventing of such as they have
reason to apprehend, and to communicate their Sentiment to
other Towns.</p>

<p><b>It was then moved by Mr. Samuel Adams, That a Committee of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
Correspondence be appointed to consist of twenty-one Persons&mdash;to
state the Rights of the Colonists and of this Province in particular,
as Men, as Christians, and as Subjects; to communicate
and publish the same to the several Towns in this Province and to
the World as the sense of this Town, with the Infringements and
Violations thereof that have been, or from time to time may be
made&mdash;Also requesting of each Town a free communication of
their Sentiments on this Subject&mdash;And the Question being accordingly
put&mdash;Passed in the Affermative. <i>Nem. Con.</i></b>&mdash;Also
Voted, that [a list headed with the names of Samuel Adams,
James Otis, and Joseph Warren] be and hereby are appointed
a Committee for the purpose aforesaid, and that they be desired
to Report to the Town as soon as may be&mdash;....</p>

<p>Then the Meeting was dissolved.</p>

agreed to meet in the evening in a private room of the <i>Raleigh</i>,
to consult on the state of things. There may have been a
member or two more whom I do not recollect. We were all
sensible that the most urgent of all measures was that of coming
to an understanding with all the other colonies, to consider
the British claims as a common cause to all, and to produce a
unity of action; and for this purpose that a committee of correspondence
in each colony would be the best instrument for
intercommunication; and that their first measure would prob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>ably
be, to propose a meeting of deputies from every colony,
at some central place, who should be charged with the direction
of the measures which should be taken by all. We
therefore drew up the resolutions. The consulting members
proposed to me to move them, but I urged that it should be
done by Mr. <i>Carr</i>, my friend and brother in law, then a member,
to whom I wished an opportunity should be given of
making known to the house his great worth and talents. It
was so agreed; he moved them. They were agreed to <i>nem.

how to prevent, or if that cannot be done, how to give the

you may depend upon, that whatever pilot brings her into the

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The colonies between 1768 and 1773 had each organized, more or less
perfectly, local committees&mdash;town or county&mdash;to enforce non-importation
agreements, and these committees often acted as "committees of
correspondence" to organize the province as a unit for action. Then in
1773 the Intercolonial Committees (No. 123) gave the germ of a standing
continental union.</p>

<p>"The next step toward revolutionary government was to develop
from the local committees the <i>Provincial</i> Congresses in individual colonies,
and from the intercolonial committees of the continent a <i>Continental</i>
Congress. These things developed <i>in the summer and fall of 1774</i>, as the
result of <i>three events</i>: (1) the attempt of the ministry to force taxed tea
down the throats of the colonists [see &sect; 121 for colonial resistance]; (2)
the rather animated protest of the Boston Tea Party; and (3) the
punishment of Boston by the Port Bill." (<i>American History and Government</i>,

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Williamsburg</span>, May 20, 1774.</p>

<p>Infinite astonishment, and equal resentment, has seized every
one here on account of the war sent to Boston. It is the universal
determination to stop the exportation of tobacco, pitch, tar,
lumber, etc., and to stop all importation from <i>Britain</i> while
this act of hostility continues. We every day expect an express
from <i>Boston</i>, and it appears to me incontestabl[y] certain, that
the above measures will be universally adopted. We see with
concern, that this plan will be most extensively hurtful to our
fellow-subjects in <i>Britain</i>; nor would we have adopted it, if
<i>Heaven</i> had left us any other way to secure our <i>liberty</i>, and prevent
the total ruin of ourselves and our posterity to endless
ages. A wicked Ministry must answer for all the consequences.
I hope the wise and good on your side will pity and forgive us.
The House is now pushing on the public business for which we
were called here at this time; but before we depart, our measures
will be settled and agreed on. The plan proposed is extensive;
it is wise, and I hope, under <i>God</i>, it will not fail of success.
<i>America</i> possesses virtue unknown and unfelt by the abominable
sons of corruption who planned this weak and wicked
enterprise.</p>

that we must boldly take an unequivocal stand in the line with

precedents and forms of the Puritans of that day [England,
in the Seventeenth century], we cooked up a resolution, somewhat
modernizing the phrases, for appointing the first day of
June, on which the Port Bill was to commence, as a day of fasting,
humiliation, and prayer. ... To give greater emphasis
to our proposition, we agreed to wait the next morning on Mr.
Nicholas, whose grave and religious character was more in unison
with the tone of our resolution, and to solicit him to move
it ... He moved it the same day ... and it passed without

<p>We his Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
representatives of the good people of this country, having
been deprived by the sudden interposition of the executive
part of this government from giving our countrymen the
advice we wished to convey to them in a legislative capacity,
find ourselves under the hard necessity of adopting this, the
only method we have left, of pointing out to our countrymen
such measures as in our opinion are best fitted to secure our
dearest rights and liberty from destruction, by the heavy
hand of power now lifted against <i>North America</i>: With much
grief we find that our dutiful applications to <i>Great Britain</i>
for security of our ancient and constitutional rights, have
been not only disregarded, but that a determined system is
formed and pressed for reducing the inhabitants of <i>British
America</i> to slavery by subjecting them to the payment
of taxes imposed without the consent of the people or
their representatives; and that in pursuit of this system,
we find an act of the British parliament, lately passed, for
stopping the harbour and commerce of the town of <i>Boston</i>, in
our sister colony of <i>Massachusetts Bay</i>, until the people there
submit to the payment of such unconstitutional taxes, and
which act most violently and arbitrarily deprives them of
their property, in wharfs erected by private persons, at their
own great and proper expense, which act is, in our opinion,
a most dangerous attempt to destroy the constitutional liberty
and rights of all <i>North America</i>. It is further our opinion,
that as Tea, on its importation into <i>America</i>, is charged with
a duty imposed by parliament for the purpose of raising a
revenue, without the consent of the people, it ought not to
be used by any person who wishes well to the constitutional
rights and liberty of British America. And <i>whereas</i> the <i>India
Company</i> have ungenerously attempted the ruin of <i>America</i>
by sending many ships loaded with tea into the colonies,
thereby intending to fix a precedent in favor of arbitrary
taxation, we deem it highly proper, and do accordingly recommend
it strongly to our countrymen, not to purchase or use
any kind of <i>East India</i> commodity whatsoever, <b>except salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>petre
and spices</b>, until the grievances of <i>America</i> are redressed.
We are further clearly of opinion, that an attack, made on
one of our sister colonies to compel submission to arbitrary
taxes, is an attack made on all British America, and threatens
ruin to the rights of all, unless the united wisdom of the
whole be applied. <b>And for this purpose it is recommended to
the Committee of Correspondence, that they communicate, with
their several corresponding committees, on the expediency of
appointing deputies from the several colonies of British America,
to meet in general congress, at such place <i>annually</i> as shall be
thought most convenient; there to deliberate on those general
measures which the united interests of America may from time
to time require.</b><a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<h4>126. Another "Call" for the Continental Congress</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>June 17, 1774, the Massachusetts House of Representatives, under the
lead of Samuel Adams (and after a carefully planned, secret campaign),
adopted the following resolutions.</p></div>

<p>That a meeting of committees from the several colonies on
this continent is highly expedient and necessary, to consult
upon the present state of the colonies, and the miseries to
which they are and must be reduced by the operation of certain
acts of Parliament respecting America, and to deliberate and
determine upon wise and proper measures, to be by them recommended
to all the colonies, for the recovery and establishment
of their just rights and liberties, civil and religious, and the
restoration of union and harmony between Great Britain and
the colonies, most ardently desired by all good men: Therefore,
resolved, that the Hon. James Bowdoin, Esq., the Hon.
Thomas Cushing, Esq., Mr. Samuel Adams, John Adams and
Robert Treat Paine, Esqrs., be, and they are hereby appointed
a committee on the part of this province, for the purposes
aforesaid, any three of whom to be a quorum, to meet such
committees or delegates from the other colonies as have been
or may be appointed, either by their respective houses of
burgesses or representatives, or by convention, or by the committees
of correspondence appointed by the respective houses
of assembly, in the city of Philadelphia, or any other place that
shall be judged most suitable by the committee, on the 1st
day of September next; and that the speaker of the house be
directed, in a letter to the speakers of the houses of burgesses
or representatives in the several colonies, to inform them of
the substance of these resolves.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This is often referred to as "the call" for the Continental Congress.
It was the first action by a colonial legislature in regular session. It did
not, however, have "legal" validity under the Charter to which the men
of Massachusetts constantly appealed. That charter (1691) required the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>assent of the upper House and the approval of the governor for every
resolution and every appointment; and these elements, of course, were
lacking. The dramatic story of Sam Adams' plot is well told in many
places,&mdash;notably in Dr. Hosmer's <i>Samuel Adams</i>.]</p></div>

General Association</h4>

<p>Force, <i>American Archives</i>, Fourth Series, I, 392-393.</p></div>

<p>At a Meeting of the Freeholders and other Inhabitants of
the County of <i>Frederick</i>, in <i>Virginia</i> ... the 8th day of June,
1774 [to consider the Boston Port Bill].</p>

<p>The Reverend Charles M. Thurston, Moderator.</p>

<p>A Committee of the following gentlemen, viz: the Reverend
Charles M. Thurston, Isaac Zane, George Rootes, Angus
McDonald, Alexander White, George Johnston, and Samuel
Beall, 3d, were appointed to draw up Resolves suitable to the
same occasion, who, withdrawing for a short time, returned
with the following votes, viz:</p>

<p><i>Voted</i>, 1st. That we will always cheerfully pay due submission
to such Acts of Government as his Majesty has a
right <b>by law</b> to exercise over his subjects, as Sovereign of the
<i>British</i> Dominions, <b>and to such only</b>.</p>

<p>2d. That it is the inherent right of <i>British</i> subjects to be
governed and taxed by Representatives chosen by themselves
only; and that every Act of the British Parliament respecting
the internal policy of North America, is a daring and unconstitutional
invasion of our said rights and privileges.</p>

<p>3d. That the Act of Parliament above mentioned is not only
in itself repugnant to the fundamental law of natural justice,
in condemning persons for a supposed crime unheard, but also
<b>a despotic exertion of unconstitutional power</b>, calculated to enslave
a free and loyal people.</p>

<p><b><i>4th. That the enforcing the execution of the said Act of Parliament
by a military Power, will have a necessary tendency to raise a
civil war, thereby dissolving that union which has so long happily subsisted
between the mother country and her Colonies; ...</i></b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>5th. It is the unanimous opinion of this meeting, that a
joint resolution of all the Colonies to stop all importations
from <i>Great Britain</i>, and exportations to it, till the said Act
shall be repealed, will prove the salvation of North America
and her liberties....</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>7th. That it is the opinion of this meeting that Committees
ought to be appointed for the purpose of effecting a general Association,
that the same measures may be pursued through the whole
Continent. That the Committees ought to correspond with each
other, and to meet at such places and times as shall be agreed on, in
order to form such General Association, and that when the same
shall be formed and agreed on by the several Committees, we will
strictly adhere thereto; and till the general sense of the Continent
shall be known, we do pledge ourselves to each other and our country,
that we will inviolably adhere to the votes of this day.</p></div>

<p>8th. That Charles M. Thurston, Isaac Zane, Angus McDonald,
Samuel Beall, 3d, Alexander White, and George Rootes,
be appointed a Committee for the purposes aforesaid; and that
they or any three of them, are hereby fully empowered to act.</p>

<p>Which being read, were unanimously assented to and subscribed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This meeting makes no reference to the action of the ex-Burgesses at
Williamsburg some ten days before, but probably it originated from that
action.]</p></div>


<h4>128. The First Call for a Provincial Convention (Virginia)</h4>


<h5><i>a. Suggestion from the Ex-Burgesses (May 30, 1774)</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Force, <i>American Archives</i>, Fourth Series, I, p. 351.</p>

<p>The ex-Burgesses, many of them, remained in Williamsburg to attend
the state ball on the 30th and for the day of prayer, June 1 (cf. No. 122 c).
On the day after the call for a Continental Congress (May 29), letters
arrived from committees of correspondence in the northern colonies, as
below noted; and the following day, twenty-five of the ex-Burgesses called
a meeting of the whole number for August 1, as below. That meeting
was expanded into a true representative convention by modifications in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
the plan indicated in <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> below. Force does not indicate the source
of the following statement; but presumably it was printed by order of
the meeting in the Williamsburg papers. Such proceedings were ordered
printed in almost every case by the various county meetings; but the
clause referring to printing is usually omitted in these extracts.</p></div>

<p>... Immediately upon receipt of these letters the Honorable
Peyton Randolph, Esquire, moderator of the Committee of the
late House of Representatives, thought it proper to convene all
the members that were then in town; who on considering those
important papers [suggesting the need of uniform action in the
various colonies], came to a resolution to call together several
other members near this city, to whom notice could be given.
[Twenty-five of them met next day, Monday, May 30, at ten
o'clock, when] it was unanimously agreed to refer the further
consideration of this matter to <i>the first day of August next</i>; at
which time it is expected there will be a very general attendance
of the late members of the House....</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This notice is referred to in a letter of June 23 by Richard Henry Lee
to Samuel Adams as follows, after describing the meeting of the ex-Burgesses
on May 27&mdash;No. 125, <i>e.</i>] ... "Most of the members, myself among
the rest, had left Williamsburg before your message from Boston arrived.
Twenty-five of them, however, were assembled to consider that message,
and they determined to invite a general meeting of the whole body on the
first of August." (Force, Fourth Series, I, 446.)</p>

<p>[Presumably the committee of correspondence sent out a circular letter
to the various counties. The editor of this volume has not been able
to find any such letter, but some of the documents just following assume
such action. After June 1, the remaining ex-Burgesses at Williamsburg
departed home, in order to arouse their respective counties to appoint
delegates for the August convention.]</p></div>


<h5><i>b. Sample Notice to a Virginia County by an Ex-Burgess</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Force, <i>American Archives</i>, Fourth Series, I, 418. Thomas Mason
writes from Williamsburg on June 16, portraying the situation, through
several pages. Only the close of the letter is given here.</p></div>

<p>If the governour should be restrained by the instructions of
a wicked Minister from relieving the distresses of the Colony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
by calling an Assembly, immediately, and writs should not be
issued for that purpose before the 1st day of July, I advise
the freeholders of each county in the Colony to convene
themselves and choose two of the most able and discreet of
their inhabitants to accompany and assist their late Representatives
at the meeting at Williamsburg, on the 1st of
August; and let the whole Colony unanimously support whatever
may be there resolved upon.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Lord Dunmore did issue writs that same day for a new Assembly, to
meet August 11. No doubt he hoped this would induce the Virginia
counties not to appoint delegates to the meeting called for August 1.
Such a purpose was suspected and defeated. (See below, &sect; 129, <i>a</i>).</p>

<p>Some counties sent only their ex-burgesses to the August Convention;
some elected new burgesses for the Assembly called for August 11, but
instructed them to attend the Convention also on the 1st; and some (as
Mason suggested) sent not only their "burgesses," but also certain additional
deputies.]</p></div>


<h5><i>c. Sample Call for a County Meeting to give Instructions
for the August Convention</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Force, <i>American Archives</i>, Fourth Series, I, 451.</p></div>

<p><i>At a meeting of the Committee of Correspondence for Norfolk
... held at the Court House, on Monday, the 27th day of June,
1774. Present [six names].</i></p>

<p><i>Voted</i> That the Freeholders and Inhabitants of the County
and Borough of Norfolk be earnestly requested to attend at
the Court House of the said County on Wednesday, the 6th
day of July next, at ten o'clock in the forenoon, that the late
Burgesses may collect their sentiments previous to the meeting
appointed to be held at Williamsburg, on the 1st day of
August next.</p>

<p class="right">William Davis, <i>Clerk</i>.</p>

<p>As late Burgesses for Norfolk ... we heartily concur ...
with the Committee of Correspondence, and propose to attend
at the time appointed. [Signatures of the ex-burgesses for the
County.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The meeting was held at the appointed time (Force, IV, 1, 518), and
adopted ten resolutions&mdash;directing "our late Burgesses" to attend the
Williamsburg Convention on August 1; to try to secure a "general association"
there for the Colony of Virginia, "against all importations and
exportations (medicines excepted) to and from Great Britain"; to try to
extend such association against every part of the colonies which should refuse
to accept the measure; and to secure the appointment in each County
of Virginia of a Committee "of respectable men ... to prevent any
breach of such ... Association as may be adopted."]</p></div>


<h4>129. Typical Virginia County Instructions to Delegates to the
First Provincial Convention</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Force has preserved records of meetings in thirty-one Virginia counties,
to appoint and instruct delegates to the Provincial Convention called
for the 1st of August. Many of these sets of instructions rank as great
state papers, quite equal in logic, rhetoric, and statesmanship to the documents
put forth by the Continental Congress three months later at
Philadelphia. The Fairfax County resolutions, which are given in about
a third part below, seem to have been in exceptional degree the model
for the resolutions adopted by the August Convention, which, in turn,
with the same Fairfax document, must have been before the committees
of the Continental Congress which drew up the famous documents
issued by that body.</p>

<p>Brief extracts from a few other Virginia county resolutions follow
the main document (<i>a</i>), to show the drift of feeling in certain plain
matters. When the exact location in Force is omitted, to save space,
it can readily be found from the index to that work.</p></div>

<h5><i>a. Westmoreland County (Virginia) Resolutions</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Force, <i>American Archives</i>, Fourth Series, I, 437, 438.</p></div>

<p>At a respectable Meeting of the Freeholders <b>and other Inhabitants</b>
of the County of Westmoreland, assembled on due notice,
at the Court House of the said County, on Wednesday, the
22d of June, 1774.</p>

<p>[The Reverend Mr. Thomas Smith, having been appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
<i>Moderator</i>], Several papers containing the Proceedings of the
late House of Burgesses of this Colony, and the subsequent
determinations of the late Representatives after the House was
dissolved, together with extracts of several Resolves of the
Provinces of Massachusetts Bay, Maryland, etc., being read, the
meeting proceeded seriously to consider the present dangerous
and truly alarming crisis, when ruin is threatened to the ancient
constitutional rights of <i>North America</i>, and came to the following
Resolves:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>7th. This meeting do heartily concur with the late Representative
body of this country, to disuse tea, and not purchase any other
commodity of the East Indies, <i>except saltpetre</i>, until the grievances
of <i>America</i> are redressed. (Cf. No. 125 <i>e</i>, above.)</b></p></div>

<p>8th. We do most heartily concur in these preceding Resolves,
and will, to the utmost of our power, take care that they are
carried into execution; and that we will regard every man as
infamous who now agree[s] to, and shall hereafter make a breach
of all or any of them; subject however to such future alterations
as shall be judged expedient, at a general meeting of
Deputies from the several parts of this Colony, or a general
Congress of all the Colonies.</p>

<p><b>9th. We do appoint <i>Richard Henry Lee</i>, and <i>Richard Lee</i>,
Esquires, the late Representatives of this county, to attend the
general meeting of Deputies from all the counties [August 1]; and
we desire that they do exert their best abilities to get these, our
earnest desires for the security of public liberty, assented to.</b></p>

<p><b>10th. And as it may happen that the Assembly now called to
meet on the 11th of August, may be prorogued to a future day, and
many of the Deputies appointed to meet on the 1st of August,
trusting to the certainty of meeting in Assembly on the 11th may
fail to attend on the first, by which means decisive injury may
arise to the common cause of liberty, by the general sense of the
country not being early known at this dangerous crisis of <i>American</i>
freedom, we do, therefore, direct that our Deputies now chosen fail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
not to attend at Williamsburg, on the said 1st of August; and it
is our earnest wish that the Deputies from other counties be
directed to do the same, for the reasons above assigned.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Other counties responded to this wish. Thus, seven days later, a "respectable
meeting of <b>Freeholders and Freemen</b> of the County of Richmond,"
called to choose and instruct delegates to the August Convention,
did so with the following caution:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"8th. This meeting do appoint Robert Wormeley Carter and Francis
L. Lee, gentlemen, as their Deputies for the purposes afore said; and
they do request them that they fail not to attend in Williamsburg on the
said first day of August, and do not trust to meeting in Assembly on the
11th ... as it is in the power of Government either to prorogue the Assembly
to a future day, or dissolve the same,&mdash;by which means the sense
of this Colony may not be known." (Force, IV, 1, 492, 493.)]</p></div>


<h5><i>b. Fairfax County (Virginia) Resolutions</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Force, <i>American Archives</i>, Fourth Series, I, 597-602.</p></div>

<p>At a General Meeting of the Freeholders and <b>other Inhabitants</b>
of the County of Fairfax, at the Court House in the
Town of Alexandria, on Monday, the 18th day of July, 1774.</p>


<ul><li><b>George Washington</b>, Esquire, <i>Chairman</i>, and</li>
<li><b>Robert Harrison</b>, Gentleman, <i>Clerk</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That this Colony and Dominion of Virginia cannot
be considered as a conquered country, and, if it was, that
the present inhabitants are the descendants, not of the conquered,
but of the conquerors. That the same was not settled
at the national expense of England, but at the private expense
of the adventurers, our ancestors ... [and] that our ancestors
... brought with them, even if the same had not been confirmed
by Charters, the civil Constitution and form of Government
of the country they came from, and were by the laws of
nature and Nations entitled to all its privileges, immunities, and
advantages, which have descended to us, their posterity....</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the most important and valuable part of the
British Constitution, upon which its very existence depends,
is the fundamental principle of the people's being governed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
no laws to which they have not given their consent by Representatives
freely chosen by themselves, <b>who are affected by the
laws they enact equally with their constituents, to whom they are
accountable and whose burthens they share</b>.</p>

<p>[The colonies "are not, and from their situation, cannot be,
represented in the British Parliament"; and therefore "legislative
power here can, <i>of right</i>, be exercised only by our Provincial
Assemblies, or <b>Parliaments</b>, subject to the assent or
negative of the British crown ..."; but it is recognized as
reasonable that the British Parliament should, <i>in practice</i>,
regulate trade "for the general good of that great body politick
of which we are a part, although in some degree repugnant to
the principles of the Constitution," but only when such power
is exercised "with wisdom and moderation."]</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the claim lately assumed and exercised by
the <i>British</i> Parliament, for making all such laws as they think
fit to govern the people of these Colonies, and to extort from
us our money without our consent, is not only diametrically
contrary to the first principles of the Constitution and the
original compacts by which we are dependent upon the <i>British</i>
Crown and Government, but is totally incompatible with the
privileges of a free people and the natural rights of mankind,
will render our own Legislatures merely nominal and nugatory,
and is calculated to reduce us from a state of freedom and
happiness to slavery and misery.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That taxation and representation are in their
nature inseparable; that the right of withholding, or of giving
and granting their own money, is the only effectual security
to a free people against the encroachments of despotism and
tyranny; and that whenever they yield the one, they must
quickly fall a prey to the other.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the powers over the people of America, now
claimed by the British House of Commons,&mdash;<b>in whose election
we have no share; in whose determinations we have no influence;
whose information must be always defective, and often false; who
in many instances may have a separate, and in some an opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
interest to ours; and who are removed from those impressions of
tenderness and compassion, arising from personal intercourse and
connection, which soften the rigours of the most despotick Government</b>,
must, if continued, establish the most grievous and
intolerable species of tyranny and oppression that ever was
inflicted upon mankind.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That it is our greatest wish and inclination, as
well as interest, to continue our connection with, and dependence
upon, the British Government; but though we are its
subjects, we will use every means which Heaven hath given
us to prevent our becoming its slaves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the several Acts of Parliament for raising a
revenue upon the people of America without their consent;
the erecting new and dangerous jurisdictions here [the "special
commissions"]; the taking away our trials by jury; the
ordering persons, on criminal accusations, to be tried in another
country than that in which the fact is charged to have been
committed; the Act inflicting Ministerial vengeance upon the
town of Boston; the two Bills lately brought into Parliament
for abrogating the charter of Massachusetts Bay, and <b>for the
protection and encouragement of murderers</b> in the said Province,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
are part of the above-mentioned iniquitous system....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That nothing will so much contribute to defeat
the pernicious designs of the common enemies of Great Britain
and her Colonies, as a firm union of the latter, who ought to
regard every act of violence or oppression inflicted upon any
one of them, as aimed at all; and to effect this desirable purpose,
<b>that a Congress should be appointed, to consist of Deputies
from all the Colonies, to concert a general and uniform plan for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>the defence and preservation of our common rights</b>, and continuing
the connection and dependence of the said Colonies upon
Great Britain, under a just, lenient, permanent, and constitutional
form of Government.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That ... all manner of luxury and extravagance
ought immediately to be laid aside, as totally inconsistent with
the threatening and gloomy prospect before us; that it is the
indispensable duty of all the gentlemen and men of fortune
to set examples of temperance, fortitude, frugality, and industry
... [and] that great care and attention should be had
to the cultivation of flax, cotton, and other materials for manufactures;
and we recommend it to such of the inhabitants as
have large stocks of sheep, to sell to their neighbors at a
moderate price, as the most certain means of speedily increasing
our breed of sheep and quantity of wool.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>[Some pages of resolves as to non-importation with much of
the detail afterward copied by the Continental Congress&mdash;especially
the following provisions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That the merchants and vendors of goods ought not to take
advantage of our present distress, but continue to sell the goods
and merchandise which they now have, or which may be
shipped to them before the 1st of September next [when non-importation
was recommended to begin], at the same rates
and prices they have been accustomed to do within one year
past; and that if any person shall sell such goods on any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>other terms ... that no inhabitant of this colony should, at
any time forever thereafter, deal with him, his agent, factor,
or storekeeper, for any commodity whatsoever"; with provisions
for depositing goods of later shippings with the committees of
their counties, <i>i.e.</i>, as adopted by the Continental Congress;
resolutions against importing slaves, and against exporting
lumber to the West Indies, and, after November 1, 1775
(unless redress of grievances should come), against <i>all</i> exports
to Great Britain. "And ... as the people will thereby be
disabled from paying their debts, that no judgments should be
rendered by the Courts ... for any debt, after imformation
of the said measures being determined upon."]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b><i>Resolved</i>, That <i>George Washington</i>, Esquire, and <i>Charles Broadwater</i>,
Gentleman, lately elected our Representatives to serve in the
General Assembly, attend the Convention at Williamsburg, on the
first day of August next, and present these Resolves as the sense of
the people of this county upon measures proper to be taken in the
present alarming and dangerous situation of America.</b></p>

<p><b><i>Resolved</i>, That George Washington Esquire, [and 24 others] be a
Committee for this county; that they, or a majority of them, on any
emergency, have power to call a general meeting, and to concert and
adopt such measures as may be thought most expedient and necessary.</b></p>

<p><b><i>Resolved</i>, That a copy of these Proceedings be transmitted to the
Printer at Williamsburg, to be published.</b></p>

<p><b>[It is possible to find in these instructions by Fairfax County to its
delegates to Williamsburg almost every provision of the "Association"
adopted three months later by the Continental Congress at
Philadelphia. For a very large part of the two documents, the
language is almost identical. Much alike as many such papers of
the time were, it is impossible to read these two together without
being convinced that the committee which framed the Association at
Philadelphia had a copy of the Fairfax instructions before them.]</b></p>


<h5><i>c. Nansemond County (July 11)</i></h5>

<p>[10] Resolved that every kind of luxury, dissipation, and extravagance,
ought to be banished from amongst us....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span></p>

<p>[12] Resolved That the African [Negro] trade is injurious to
this Colony, obstructs the population of it by freemen, prevents
manufactures and useful emigrants from Europe from settling
amongst us and occasions an annual increase of the balance of
trade against the colony.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>[14] Resolved that to be clothed in manufactures fabricated
in this Colony ought to be considered as a badge and distinction
of respect and true patriotism.</p>


<h5><i>d. York County (July 18)</i></h5>

<p>[Instructions to delegates for the August Convention, after
urging appointment of Virginia delegates to a "General Congress

<p>"That these Representatives be instructed to form a Declaration

<p><b>"That industry and frugality be adopted, in their largest extent,

<h5><i>e. Middlesex County (July 15)</i></h5>

<p>[This county alone takes a royalist tone.]</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That we do not approve of the conduct of the people of Boston
in destroying the tea ... and notwithstanding the tax on tea must
be esteemed a violent infringement of one of the fundamental privileges ...
yet we apprehend violence cannot justify violence. ... A desistance from
the consumption of tea, and a confidence in the virtue of our countrymen,
whose sense of the spirit of the law will no doubt induce a total disuse of
it, are much more eligible means, and more probably will work a repeal
of the Act, than disorders, outrages, and tumults.</p></div>

<h4>130. The First Continental Congress</h4>


<h5><i>a. Method of Voting, etc.</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>John Adams' "Diary" (<i>Works</i>, II, 366 ff.).</p></div>

<p>[Sept.] 5. Monday. At ten the delegates all met at the City
Tavern, and walked to the Carpenters' Hall, where they took a
view of the room, and of the chamber where is an excellent library;
there is also a long entry where gentlemen may walk, and
a convenient chamber opposite to the library. The general cry
was, that this was a good room, and the question was put,
whether we were satisfied with this room? and it passed in the
affirmative. A very few were for the negative, and they were
chiefly from Pennsylvania and New York. Then Mr. Lynch
arose, and said there was a gentleman present who had presided
with great dignity over a very respectable society, greatly
to the advantage of America, and he therefore proposed that
the Honorable Peyton Randolph, Esquire, one of the delegates
from Virginia, and the late Speaker of their House of Burgesses;
should be appointed Chairman, and he doubted not it
would be unanimous.</p>

<p>The question was put, and he was unanimously chosen.</p>

<p>Mr. Randolph then took the chair, and the commissions of
the delegates were all produced and read.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Lynch proposed that Mr. Charles Thomson, a gentleman
of family, fortune, and character in this city, should be
appointed Secretary, which was accordingly done without opposition,
though Mr. Duane and Mr. Jay discovered at first an
inclination to seek further.</p>

<p>Mr. Duane then moved that a committee should be appointed
to prepare regulations for this Congress. Several gentlemen
objected.</p>

<p>I then arose and asked leave of the President to request of
the gentleman from New York an explanation, and that he
would point out some particular regulations which he had in his
mind. He mentioned particularly the method of voting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
whether it should be by Colonies, or by the poll, or by interests.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry then rose, and said this was the first General
Congress which had ever happened; that no former Congress
could be a precedent; that we should have occasion for more
general congresses, and therefore that a precedent ought to be
established now; that it would be great injustice if a little
Colony should have the same weight in the councils of America
as a great one, and therefore he was for a committee.</p>

<p>Major Sullivan [from New Hampshire] observed that a little
Colony had its all at stake as well as a great one....</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Henry.</i> Government is dissolved. Fleets and armies
and the present state of things show that government is dissolved.
Where are your landmarks, your boundaries of Colonies?
We are in a state of nature, sir....</p>

<p>The distinctions between Virginians Pennsylvanians, New
Yorkers, and New Englanders, are no more. I am not a Virginian,
but an American.</p>

<p>Slaves are to be thrown out of the question, and if the freemen
can be represented according to their numbers, I am
satisfied.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Lynch.</i> I differ in one point from the gentleman from
Virginia, that is, in thinking that numbers only ought to
determine the weight of Colonies. I think that property ought
to be considered, and that it ought to be a compound of numbers
and property that should determine the weight of the
Colonies.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>I think it cannot be now settled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. <i>Lee.</i> But one reason ... prevails with me [for favoring
one vote to each colony] ... that we are not at this time provided
with proper materials [to assign proper proportions]....</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Gadsen.</i> I can't see any way of voting but by Colonies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. <i>Pendleton.</i> If the committee should find themselves
unable to ascertain the weight of the Colonies, by their numbers
and property, they will report this, and this will lay the
foundation for the Congress to take some other steps to procure
evidence of numbers and property at some future time.</p>

<p><i>Mr Henry.</i> I agree that authentic accounts cannot be had,
if by authenticity is meant attestations of officers of the
Crown.</p>

<p>I go upon the supposition that government is at an end.
All distinctions are thrown down. All America is thrown
into one mass. We must aim at the minuti&aelig; of rectitude.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The argument that the delegates lacked information (such as a census
would have provided) to arrange a proper apportionment of votes to
different colonies prevailed. October 10, the Connecticut delegates
wrote to the governor of their colony: "The mode of voting ... was
first resolved upon; which was that each colony should have one voice;
but, as this was objected to as unequal, an entry was made in the journals
to prevent its being drawn into precedent in future."</p></div>


<h5><i>b. John Adams' Impressions toward the Close</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Diary</i>, as above.</p></div>

<p>[Oct.] 10. Monday. The deliberations of the Congress are
spun out to an immeasurable length. There is so much wit,
sense, learning, acuteness, subtlety, eloquence, etc., among fifty
gentlemen, each of whom has been habituated to lead and guide
in his own Province, that an immensity of time is spent unnecessarily.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>24. Monday. In Congress, nibbling and quibbling as usual.
There is no greater mortification than to sit with half a dozen
wits, deliberating upon a petition, address, or memorial. These
great wits, these subtle critics, these refined geniuses, these
learned lawyers, these wise statesmen, are so fond of showing
their parts and powers, as to make their consultations very
tedious. Young Ned Rutledge is a perfect Bob-o-Lincoln,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>a
swallow, a sparrow, a peacock; excessively vain, excessively
weak, and excessively variable and unsteady; jejune, inane,
and puerile. Mr. Dickinson is very modest, delicate, and timid.
Spent the evening at home. Colonel Dyer, Judge Sherman,
and Colonel Floyd came in, and spent the evening with Mr.
[Samuel] Adams and me. Mr. Mifflin and General Lee came in.
Lee's head is running upon his new plan of a battalion....</p>

<p>26. Wednesday. Dined at home. This day the Congress
finished. Spent the evening together at the City Tavern; all
the Congress, and several gentlemen of the town....</p>

<p>28. Friday. Took our departure, in a very great rain, from
the happy, the peaceful, the elegant, the hospitable, and polite
city of Philadelphia. It is not very likely that I shall ever see
this part of the world again, but I shall ever retain a most
grateful, pleasing sense of the many civilities I have received
in it, and shall think myself happy to have an opportunity of
returning them.</p>

<p>[Delegates from eleven colonies to the First Continental Congress assembled
at Philadelphia, September 5, 1774. Delegates from North Carolina
appeared on the 14th. Georgia was not represented. For elections
and credentials, cf. <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 141.]</p></div>


<h5><i>c. Declaration of Rights</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Journals of the Continental Congress</i> (Ford edition), I, 63 ff. A committee,
appointed on September 7, reported on the 22d. The report was
taken up October 12, and adopted October 14.</p></div>

<p>Whereas, since the close of the last war, the British parliament,
claiming a power, of right, to bind the people of America
by statutes in all cases whatsoever, hath, in some acts, expressly
imposed taxes on them, and in others, under various pretences,
but in fact for the purpose of raising a revenue, hath imposed
rates and duties payable in these colonies, established a board of
commissioners, with unconstitutional powers, and extended the
jurisdiction of courts of admiralty, not only for collecting the said
duties, but for the trial of causes merely arising within the body
of a county.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>And whereas, in consequence of other statutes, judges, who
before held only estates at will in their offices, have been made
dependant on the crown alone for their salaries, and standing
armies kept in times of peace: And whereas it has lately been
resolved in parliament, that by force of a statute, made in the
thirty-fifth year of the reign of King Henry the Eighth, colonists
may be transported to England, and tried there upon accusations
for treasons and misprisions, or concealments of treasons committed
in the colonies, and by a late statute, such trials have been
directed in cases therein mentioned:</p>

<p>And whereas, in the last session of parliament, three statutes
were made; one entitled, "An act to discontinue, in such manner
and for such time as are therein mentioned, the landing and discharging,
lading, or shipping of goods, wares and merchandize,
at the town, and within the harbour of Boston, in the province
of Massachusetts-Bay in North-America;" another entitled, "An
act for the better regulating the government of the province of
Massachusetts-Bay in New England;" and another entitled, "An
act for the impartial administration of justice, in the cases of
persons questioned for any act done by them in the execution of
the law, or for the suppression of riots and tumults, in the province
of the Massachusetts-Bay in New England;" and another
statute was then made, "for making more effectual provision
for the government of the province of Quebec, etc." All which
statutes are impolitic, unjust, and cruel, as well as unconstitutional,
and most dangerous and destructive of American rights:</p>

<p>And whereas, assemblies have been frequently dissolved,
contrary to the rights of the people, when they attempted to
deliberate on grievances; and their dutiful, humble, loyal, and
reasonable petitions to the crown for redress, have been repeatedly
treated with contempt, by his Majesty's ministers of
state:</p>

<p>The good people of the several colonies of New-Hampshire,
Massachusetts-Bay, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations,
Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Newcastle,
Kent, and Sussex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>-Carolina,
and South-Carolina, justly alarmed at these arbitrary
proceedings of parliament and administration, have severally
elected, constituted, and appointed deputies to meet, and sit in
general Congress, in the city of Philadelphia, in order to obtain
such establishment, as that their religion, laws, and liberties,
may not be subverted: Whereupon the deputies so appointed
being now assembled, in a full and free representation of these
colonies, taking into their most serious consideration, the best
means of attaining the ends aforesaid, do, in the first place, as
Englishmen, their ancestors in like cases have usually done, for
asserting and vindicating their rights and liberties, DECLARE,</p>

<p>That the inhabitants of the English colonies in North-America,
by the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the
English constitution, and the several charters or compacts,
have the following RIGHTS:</p>

<p><i>Resolved, N. C. D.</i> 1. That they are entitled to life, liberty
and property: and they have never ceded to any foreign power
whatever, a right to dispose of either without their consent.</p>

<p><i>Resolved, N. C. D.</i> 2. That our ancestors, who first settled
these colonies, were at the time of their emigration from the
mother country, entitled to all the rights, liberties, and immunities
of free and natural-born subjects, within the realm of
England.</p>

<p><i>Resolved, N. C. D.</i> 3. That by such emigration they by no
means forfeited, surrendered, or lost any of those rights, but
that they were, and their descendants now are, entitled to the
exercise and enjoyment of all such of them, as their local and
other circumstances enable them to exercise and enjoy.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, 4. That the foundation of English liberty, and of
all free government, is a right in the people to participate in
their legislative council: and as the English colonists are not
represented, and from their local and other circumstances, cannot
properly be represented in the British parliament, they are
entitled to a free and exclusive power of legislation in their
several provincial legislatures, where their right of representation
can alone be preserved, in all cases of taxation and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>ternal
polity, subject only to the negative of their sovereign,
in such manner as has been heretofore used and accustomed:
But, from the necessity of the case, and a regard to the mutual
interest of both countries, we cheerfully consent to the operation
of such acts of the British parliament, as are, <i>bona fide</i>, restrained
to the regulation of our external commerce, for the
purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole
empire to the mother country, and the commercial benefits of
its respective members; excluding every idea of taxation
internal or external, for raising a revenue on the subjects, in
America, without their consent.</p>

<p><i>Resolved, N. C. D.</i> 5. That the respective colonies are entitled
to the common law of England, and more especially to
the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers
of the vicinage, according to the course of that law.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, 6. That they are entitled to the benefit of such of
the English statutes, as existed at the time of their colonization;
and which they have, by experience, respectively found to be
applicable to their several local and other circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Resolved, N. C. D.</i> 7. That these, his majesty's colonies,
are likewise entitled to all the immunities and privileges granted
and confirmed to them by royal charters, or secured by their
several codes of provincial laws.</p>

<p><i>Resolved, N. C. D.</i> 8. That they have a right peaceably to
assemble, consider of their grievances, and petition the king;
and that all prosecutions, prohibitory proclamations, and commitments
for the same, are illegal.</p>

<p><i>Resolved, N. C. D.</i> 9. That the keeping a standing army
in these colonies, in times of peace, without the consent of the
legislature of that colony, in which such army is kept, is against
law.</p>

<p><i>Resolved, N. C. D.</i> 10. It is indispensably necessary to good
government, and rendered essential by the English constitution,
that the constituent branches of the legislature be independent
of each other; that, therefore, the exercise of legislative power
in several colonies by a council appointed, during pleasure, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
the crown, is unconstitutional, dangerous and destructive to
the freedom of American legislation.</p>

<p>All and each of which the aforesaid deputies, in behalf of themselves,
and their constituents, do claim, demand, and insist on,
as their indubitable rights and liberties; which cannot be legally
taken from them, altered or abridged by any power whatever,
without their own consent, by their representatives in their
several provincial legislatures.</p>

<p>In the course of our inquiry, we find many infringements
and violations of the foregoing rights, which, from an ardent
desire that harmony and mutual intercourse of affection and
interest may be restored, we pass over for the present, and proceed
to state such acts and measures as have been adopted since
the last war, which demonstrate a system formed to enslave
America.</p>

<p><i>Resolved, N. C. D.</i> That the following acts of parliament are
infringements and violations of the rights of the colonists; and
that the repeal of them is essentially necessary, in order to restore
harmony between Great-Britain and the American colonies,
viz.</p>

<p>The several acts of 4 Geo. III. ch. 15, and ch. 34.&mdash;5 Geo.
III. ch. 25.&mdash;6 Geo. III. ch. 52.&mdash;7 Geo. III. ch. 41, and ch.
46.&mdash;8 Geo. III. ch. 22. which impose duties for the purpose
of raising a revenue in America, extend the power of the admiralty
courts beyond their ancient limits, deprive the American
subject of trial by jury, authorise the judges certificate to
indemnify the prosecutor from damages, that he might otherwise
be liable to, requiring oppressive security from a claimant
of ships and goods seized, before he shall be allowed to defend
his property, are subversive of American rights.</p>

<p>Also 12 Geo. III. ch. 24. intituled, "An act for the better securing
his majesty's dockyards, magazines, ships, ammunition,
and stores," which declares a new offence in America, and deprives
the American subject of a constitutional trial by jury
of the vicinage, by authorising the trial of any person, charged
with the committing any offence described in the said act, out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
of the realm, to be indicted and tried for the same in any shire
or county within the realm.</p>

<p>Also the three acts passed in the last session of parliament,
for stopping the port and blocking up the harbour of Boston,
for altering the charter and government of Massachusetts-Bay,
and that which is entitled, "An act for the better administration
of justice, etc."</p>

<p>Also the act passed in the same session for establishing the
Roman Catholic religion, in the province of Quebec, abolishing,
the equitable system of English laws, and erecting a tyranny
there, to the great danger, (from so total a dissimilarity of religion,
law and government) of the neighbouring British colonies,
by the assistance of whose blood and treasure the said country
was conquered from France.</p>

<p>Also the act passed in the same session, for the better providing
suitable quarters for officers and soldiers in his majesty's
service, in North-America.</p>

<p>Also, that the keeping a standing army in several of these
colonies, in time of peace, without the consent of the legislature
of that colony in which such army is kept, is against law.</p>

<p>To these grievous acts and measures, Americans cannot submit,
but in hopes their fellow subjects in Great-Britain will, by
a revision of them, restore us to that state, in which both countries
found happiness and prosperity, we have for the present,
only resolved to pursue the following peaceable measures: 1.
To enter into a non-importation, non-consumption, and non-exportation
agreement or association. 2. To prepare an address
to the people of Great-Britain, and a memorial to the inhabitants
of British America: and 3. To prepare a loyal address to
his majesty, agreeable to resolutions already entered into.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This "Declaration" confines itself almost wholly, it will be observed,
to "concrete" English rights, which had been infringed by recent acts
of government. There is little suggestion of the more general principles
soon to appear, first in the Virginia bill of rights and then in the Declaration
of Independence. Advanced students will find in John Adams' <i>Works</i>
(II, 373 ff.) an autobiographical extract, <i>composed in 1804</i>, giving Adams'

<p>WE, his majesty's most loyal subjects, the delegates of the
several colonies of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts-Bay, Rhode-Island,
Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania,
the three lower counties of Newcastle, Kent and Sussex on
Delaware,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, and South-Carolina,
deputed to represent them in a continental Congress,
held in the city of Philadelphia, on the fifth day of September,
1774, avowing our Allegiance to his majesty, our affection and
regard for our fellow-subjects in Great Britain and elsewhere,
affected with the deepest anxiety, and most alarming apprehensions,
at those grievances and distresses with which his
majesty's American subjects are oppressed; and having taken
under our most serious deliberation the state of the whole
continent, find, that the present unhappy situation of our
affairs is occasioned by a ruinous system of colony administration,
adopted by the British ministry about the year 1763,
evidently calculated for inslaving these colonies, and, with
them, the British Empire. In prosecution of which system,
various acts of parliament have been passed, for raising a
revenue in America, for depriving the American subjects, in
many instances, of the constitutional trial by jury, exposing
their lives to danger, by directing a new and illegal trial beyond
the seas, for crimes alleged to have been committed in
America: And in prosecution of the same system, several late,
cruel, and oppressive acts have been passed, respecting the
town of Boston and the Massachusetts-Bay, and also an act
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>for extending the province of Quebec, so as to border on the
western frontiers of these colonies, establishing an arbitrary
government therein, and discouraging the settlement of British
subjects in that wide extended country; thus, by the influence
of civil principles and ancient prejudices, to dispose the inhabitants
to act with hostility against the free Protestant
colonies, whenever a wicked ministry shall chuse so to direct
them.</p>

<p>To obtain redress of these grievances, which threaten destruction
to the lives, liberty, and property of his majesty's
subjects, in North-America, we are of opinion, that a non-importation,
non-consumption, and non-exportation agreement,
faithfully adhered to, will prove the most speedy, effectual,
and peaceable measure: And, therefore, we do, for ourselves,
and the inhabitants of the several colonies, whom we represent,
firmly agree and associate, under the sacred ties of virtue,
honour and love of our country, as follows:</p>

<p>First, That from and after the first day of December next,
we will not import, into British America, from Great-Britain
or Ireland, any goods, wares, or merchandize whatsoever, or
from any other place, any such goods, wares, or merchandize,
as shall have been exported from Great-Britain or Ireland;
nor will we, after that day, import any East-India tea from
any part of the world; nor any molasses, syrups, paneles,
coffee, or pimento, from the British plantations or from
Dominica; nor wines from Madeira, or the Western Islands;
nor foreign indigo.</p>

<p>Second, We will neither import nor purchase, any slave
imported after the first day of December next; after which
time, we will wholly discontinue the slave trade, and will
neither be concerned in it ourselves, nor will we hire our
vessels, nor sell our commodities or manufactures to those
who are concerned in it.</p>

<p>Third, As a non-consumption agreement, strictly adhered to,
will be an effectual security for the observation of the non-importation,
we, as above, solemnly agree and associate, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
from this day, we will not purchase or use any tea, imported on
account of the East-India company, or any on which a duty
hath been or shall be paid; and from and after the first day
of March next, we will not purchase or use any East-India
tea whatever; nor will we, nor shall any person for or under
us, purchase or use any of those goods, wares, or merchandize,
we have agreed not to import, which we shall know, or
have cause to suspect, were imported after the first day of
December, except such as come under the rules and directions
of the tenth article hereafter mentioned.</p>

<p>Fourth, The earnest desire we have not to injure our fellow-subjects
in Great-Britain, Ireland, or the West-Indies, induces
us to suspend a non-exportation, until the tenth day of September,
1775; at which time, if the said acts and parts of acts
of the British parliament herein after mentioned, are not
repealed, we will not directly or indirectly, export any merchandize
or commodity whatsoever to Great-Britain, Ireland,
or the West-Indies, except rice to Europe.</p>

<p>Fifth, Such as are merchants, and use the British and Irish
trade, will give orders, as soon as possible, to their factors,
agents and correspondents, in Great-Britain and Ireland, not
to ship any goods to them, on any pretence whatsoever, as
they cannot be received in America; and if any merchant,
residing in Great-Britain or Ireland, shall directly or indirectly
ship any goods, wares or merchandize, for America, in order
to break the said non-importation agreement, or in any manner
contravene the same, on such unworthy conduct being well
attested, it ought to be made public; and, on the same being
so done, we will not, from thenceforth, have any commercial
connexion with such merchant.</p>

<p>Sixth, That such as are owners of vessels will give positive
orders to their captains, or masters, not to receive on board
their vessels any goods prohibited by the said non-importation
agreement, on pain of immediate dismission from their service.</p>

<p>Seventh, We will use our utmost endeavours to improve the
breed of sheep, and increase their number to the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
extent; and to that end, we will kill them as seldom as may be,
especially those of the most profitable kind; nor will we
export any to the West-Indies or elsewhere; and those of us,
who are or may become overstocked with, or can conveniently
spare any sheep, will dispose of them to our neighbours,
especially to the poorer sort, on moderate terms.</p>

<p>Eighth, We will, in our several stations, encourage frugality,
&oelig;conomy, and industry, and promote agriculture, arts and the
manufactures of this country, especially that of wool; and
will discountenance and discourage every species of extravagance
and dissipation, especially all horse-racing, and all kinds
of gaming, cock-fighting, exhibitions of shews, plays, and
other expensive diversions and entertainments; and on the
death of any relation or friend, none of us, or any of our
families, will go into any further mourning-dress than a black
crape or ribbon on the arm or hat, for gentlemen, and a black
ribbon and necklace for ladies, and we will discontinue the
giving of gloves and scarves at funerals.</p>

<p>Ninth, Such as are venders of goods or merchandize will
not take advantage of the scarcity of goods that may be
occasioned by this association, but will sell the same at the
rates we have been respectively accustomed to do, for twelve
months last past.&mdash;And if any vender of goods or merchandize
shall sell such goods on higher terms, or shall, in any
manner, or by any device whatsoever, violate or depart from
this agreement, no person ought, nor will any of us deal with
any such person, or his or her factor or agent, at any time
thereafter, for any commodity whatever.</p>

<p>Tenth, In case any merchant, trader, or other person, shall
import any goods or merchandize, after the first day of December,
and before the first day of February next, the same ought
forthwith, at the election of the owner, to be either re-shipped
or delivered up to the committee of the county or town,
wherein they shall be imported, to be stored at the risque of
the importer, until the non-importation agreement shall cease,
or be sold under the direction of the committee aforesaid;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
and in the last-mentioned case, the owner or owners of such
goods shall be reimbursed out of the sales, the first cost and
charges, the profit, if any, to be applied towards relieving and
employing such poor inhabitants of the town of Boston, as are
immediate sufferers by the Boston port-bill; and a particular
account of all goods so returned, stored, or sold, to be inserted
in the public papers; and if any goods or merchandizes shall
be imported after the said first day of February, the same
ought forthwith to be sent back again, without breaking any
of the packages thereof.</p>

<p>Eleventh, That a committee be chosen in every county, city,
and town, by those who are qualified to vote for representatives
in the legislature, whose business it shall be attentively
to observe the conduct of all persons touching this association;
and when it shall be made to appear, to the satisfaction of a
majority of any such committee, that any person within the
limits of their appointment has violated this association, that
such majority do forthwith cause the truth of the case to be published
in the gazette; to the end, that all such foes to the rights
of British-America may be publicly known, and universally
contemned as the enemies of American liberty; and thenceforth
we respectively will break off all dealings with him or her.</p>

<p>Twelfth, That the committee of correspondence, in the
respective colonies, do frequently inspect the entries of their
custom-houses, and inform each other, from time to time, of the
true state thereof, and of every other material circumstance
that may occur relative to this association.</p>

<p>Thirteenth, That all manufactures of this country be sold at
reasonable prices, so that no undue advantage be taken of a
future scarcity of goods.</p>

<p>Fourteenth, And we do further agree and resolve, that we
will have no trade, commerce, dealings or intercourse whatsoever,
with any colony or province, in North-America, which
shall not accede to, or which shall hereafter violate this association,
but will hold them as unworthy of the rights of freemen,
and as inimical to the liberties of their country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<p>And we do solemnly bind ourselves and our constituents,
under the ties aforesaid, to adhere to this association, until
such parts of the several acts of parliament, passed since the
close of the last war, as impose or continue duties on tea, wine,
molasses, syrups, paneles, coffee, sugar, pimento, indigo, foreign
paper, glass, and painters colours, imported into America,
and extend the powers of the admiralty courts beyond their
ancient limits, deprive the American subject of trial by
jury, authorise the judge's certificate to indemnify the prosecutor
from damages, that he might otherwise be liable to,
from a trial by his peers, require oppressive security from a
claimant of ships or goods seized, before he shall be allowed
to defend his property, are repealed.&mdash;And until that part of
the act of the 12. G. 3. ch. 24. entitled, "An act for the better
securing his majesty's dockyards, magazines, ships, ammunition,
and stores," by which any persons charged with committing
any of the offences therein described, in America, may be
tried in any shire or county within the realm, is repealed&mdash;and
until the four acts, passed the last session of parliament,
viz. that for stopping the port and blocking up the harbour
of Boston&mdash;that for altering the charter and government of
the Massachusetts-Bay&mdash;and that which is entitled, "An act
for the better administration of justice, etc."&mdash;and that "For
extending the limits of Quebec, etc." are repealed. And we
recommend it to the provincial conventions, and to the committees
in the respective colonies, to establish such farther
regulations as they may think proper, for carrying into execution
this association.</p>

<p>In consequence of the eleventh Resolution of the Continental
Congress, the Freeholders of the County of Prince William, being
convened at the house of William Reno on Monday, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
9th day of December, 1774, proceeded to elect the following
gentlemen as a Committee for the said County: [25 names].</p>

<p>[Notice of the organization of the Committee by election of its
chairman and clerk&mdash;and then a series of six resolutions
adopted by it. Four of them are given below.]</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the thanks of the Committee are due to the
Deputies of this Colony, for their wise, firm, and patriotick
conduct in the late Continental Congress.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That whenever there appears ... cause to suspect
that any Merchant ... of this County has violated the
Association ... by raising the price of his Goods, such
Trader be called upon to show his day-books and invoices, to
clear up such suspicion; and that, in case of refusal, he be
deemed guilty ... and subject to the penalties in such case
provided....</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That all publick Balls and Entertainments be
discountenanced in this county from this time, as contrary to
the sentiments of the Continental Congress....</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That no person in this County ought to purchase
more Goods in one year than he has been accustomed to do ...
that the poor ... may not be distressed by wealthy designing
men.</p>

<h4>132. Virginia County "Conventions" become De Facto
Governments</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Force, <i>American Archives</i>, Fourth Series, I, 1145.</p>

<p>For the occasion for the "second conventions" in the various colonies in
the winter of 1774-5, cf. <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 143.</p>

<p>The Virginia Convention of August 1-6, 1774, had appointed delegates
to the Continental Congress to be held in September at Philadelphia, and
adjourned after authorizing its chairman to call another convention when
necessary. <i>It was only an informal conference.</i></p>

<p>In December, a <i>Second Maryland Convention</i> virtually became a <i>de facto</i>
government, arming the province for defense against England. This
example was followed promptly in single <i>counties</i> in Virginia,&mdash;first in
George Washington's County.</p></div>

County, on the 17th of January 1775.</i>]</p>


<ul><li><b>George Washington</b>, Esquire, <i>Chairman</i>,</li>
<li><b>Robert H. Harrison</b>, <i>Clerk</i>:</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the defenceless state of this County renders
it indispensably neccessary that a quantity of Ammunition
should be immediately provided; and as the same will be for
the common benefit, protection, and defence of the inhabitants
thereof, it is but just and reasonable that the expenses incurred
in procuring the same should be defrayed by a general and
equal contribution. It is therefore recommended that the sum
of three Shillings per poll, for the purpose aforesaid, be paid
by and for every tithable person in this County, to the
Sheriff, or such other Collector as may be appointed, who is to
render the same to this Committee, with a list of the names
of such persons as shall refuse to pay the same, if any such
there be.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That this Committee do concur in opinion with the
Provincial Committee of the Province of Maryland, that a
well regulated Militia, composed of gentlemen freeholders, and
other freemen, is the natural strength and only stable security
of a free Government, and that such Militia will relieve our
mother country from any expense in our protection and defence,
will obviate the pretence of a necessity for taxing us on
that account, and render it unnecessary to keep Standing
Armies among us&mdash;ever dangerous to liberty; and therefore
it is recommended to such of the inhabitants of this County as
are from sixteen to fifty years of age, to form themselves into
Companies of sixty-eight men; to choose a Captain, two
Lieutenants, an Ensign, four Sergeants, four Corporals, and
one Drummer, for each Company; that they provide themselves
with good Firelocks, and use their utmost endeavours to
make themselves masters of the Military Exercise, published
by order of his Majesty in 1764, and recommended by the
Provincial Congress of the Massachusetts Bay, on the 29th
of October last.</p>

[Present: 120 names.]...</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Honourable <i>Peyton Randolph</i>, Esquire, was unanimously
elected President of this Convention, and Mr. <i>John Tazewell</i>,
Clerk thereof.</p>

<p>The President then recommended it to the Convention to
proceed in the deliberation and discussion of the several
important matters which should come before them, with that
prudence, decency, and order which had distinguished their
conduct on all former occasions; and laid before the Convention
the proceedings of the Continental Congress....</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That this Convention will observe, in their debates,
the same rules and orders as are established in the House of
Burgesses in this Colony.</p>

<p>Adjourned till to-morrow 10 o'clock.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>March 21. ... <i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That this Convention
doth entirely and cordially approve the Proceedings and Resolutions
of the <i>American</i> Continental Congress [the "First Continental Congress"],
and that they consider this whole Continent as under the
highest obligations to that very respectable body, for the wisdom of
their counsels, and their unremitted endeavours to maintain and preserve
inviolate the just rights and liberties of His Majesty's dutiful
and loyal subjects in <i>America</i>.</b></p>

<p><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That the warmest thanks of this Convention,
and all the inhabitants of this Colony, whom they
represent, are particularly due, and that this just tribute of
applause be presented, to the Honourable <i>Peyton Randolph</i>
Esquire, <i>Richard Henry Lee</i>, <i>George Washington</i>, <i>Patrick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
Henry</i>, Junior, <i>Richard Bland</i>, <i>Benjamin Harrison</i>, and <i>Edmund
Pendleton</i>, Esquires, the worthy Delegates deputed by a former
Convention to represent this Colony in General Congress, for
their cheerful undertaking, and faithful discharge of the very
important trust reposed in them.</p>

<p>Adjourned till to-morrow 10 o'clock.</p>

<p><b>March 22. ... <i>Resolved</i>, That a well regulated Militia,
composed of Gentlemen and Yeomen, is the natural strength, and
only security of a free Government; that such a Militia in this
Colony would for ever render it unnecessary for the Mother
Country to keep among us, for the purpose of our defence, any
Standing Army of mercenary forces, always subversive of the
quiet, and dangerous to the liberties of the people, and would
obviate the pretext of taxing us for their support.</b></p>

<p>That the establishment of such Militia is at this time
peculiarly necessary, by the state of our laws for the protection
and defence of the Country, some of which have already expired,
and others will shortly do so; and that the known remissness
of Government, in calling us together in a legislative
capacity renders it too insecure, in this time of danger and distress
to rely, that opportunity will be given of renewing them
in General Assembly, or making any provision to secure our
inestimable rights and liberties from those farther violations
with which they are threatened.</p>

<p><i>Resolved therefore</i>, That this Colony be immediately put into
a posture of defence; and that Patrick Henry, Richard Henry
Lee, Robert Carter Nicholas, Benjamin Harrison, Lemuel Riddick,
George Washington, Adam Stephen, Andrew Lewis,
William Christian, Edmund Pendleton, Thomas Jefferson, and
Isaac Zane, Esquires, be a Committee to prepare a plan for the
embodying, arming, and disciplining such a number of men as
may be sufficient for that purpose.</p>

<p>Adjourned till to-morrow 10 o'clock....</p>

<p>Saturday, March 25, 1775. ... <i>Resolved</i>, As the opinion
of this Convention, that, on account of the unhappy disputes
between Great Britain and the Colonies, and the unsettled state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
of this Country, the lawyers, suitors, and witnesses ought not
to attend the prosecution or defence of civil suits at the next
General Court; and it is recommended to the several Courts of
Justice not to proceed to the hearing or determination of suits
on their dockets, except attachments; nor to give judgments
but in the case of Sheriffs or other collectors for Money or
Tobacco received by them; in other cases, where such judgment
shall be voluntarily confessed; or upon such amicable proceedings
as may become necessary for the settlement, division, or
distribution of estates. And, during this suspension of the
administration of justice, it is earnestly recommended to the
people to observe a peaceable and orderly behaviour; to all
creditors to be as indulgent to their debtors as may be; to all
debtors to pay as far as they are able; and where differences
may arise which cannot be adjusted between the parties, that
they refer the decision thereof to judicious neighbours, and
abide by their determination.</p>

<p>The Convention then took into their consideration, according
to the order of yesterday, the plan for embodying, arming and
disciplining the Militia; which, being read, and amended, was
unanimously agreed to, as follows:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The committee are further of opinion that, as from the expiration
of the above-mentioned latter laws, and various other causes,
the legal and necessary disciplining the Militia has been much
neglected, and a proper provision of Arms and Ammunition has
not been made, to the evident danger of the community in case
of invasion or insurrection, <b>it be recommended to the inhabitants
of the several Counties of this Colony that they form one or more
volunteer Companies of Infantry and Troops of Horse, in each County,
and to be in constant training and readiness to act on any emergency</b>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>That, in order to make a further and more ample provision of
Amunition, it be recommended to the Committees of the several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
Counties, that they collect from their Constituents, in such manner
as shall be most agreeable to them, so much money as will be sufficient
to purchase half a pound of Gunpowder, one pound of Lead,
necessary Flints and Cartridge Paper, and dispose thereof, when
procured, in such place or places of safety as they may think best;
and it is earnestly recommended to each individual to pay such
proportion of the money necessary for these purposes as by the
respective Committees shall be judged requisite.</b></p>

<p>That as it may happen that some Counties, from their situation,
may not be apprized of the most certain and speedy
method of procuring the articles before-mentioned, one General
Committee should be appointed, whose business it should be
to procure, for such Counties as may make application to them,
such articles, and so much thereof as the moneys wherewith
they shall furnish the said Committee with purchase, after
deducting the charges of transportation, and other necessary
expenses.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That Robert Carter Nicholas, Thomas Nelson, and
Thomas Whiting, Esquires, or any two of them, be a Committee
for the purpose afore-mentioned.</p>

<p>... <i>Resolved</i>, That <i>Robert Carter Nicholas</i>, <i>Richard Bland</i>,
<i>James Mercer</i>, <i>Edmund Pendleton</i>, <i>Archibald Cary</i>, <i>Charles
Carter</i> of <i>Stafford</i>, <i>Benjamin Harrison</i>, <i>Richard Henry Lee</i>,
<i>Josias Clapham</i>, <i>George Washington</i>, <i>Patrick Henry</i>, <i>James
Holt</i>, and <i>Thomas Newton</i>, Esquires, be a Committee to prepare
a plan for the encouragement of Arts and Manufactures in
this Colony.</p>

<p><b>The Convention then proceeded to the election of Delegates by
ballot, to represent this Colony in General Congress, to be held
at the City of <i>Philadelphia</i>, on the 10th day of <i>May</i> next; when
the Honourable <i>Peyton Randolph</i>, Esquire, <i>George Washington</i>,
<i>Patrick Henry</i>, <i>Richard Henry Lee</i>, <i>Edmund Pendleton</i>, <i>Benjamin
Harrison</i>, and <i>Richard Bland</i>, Esquires, were chosen for that
purpose.</b></p>

<p><b><i>Resolved</i>, That <i>Robert Carter Nicholas</i>, Esquire, be desired to lay
before the Convention, on Monday next, an account of the Money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
received from the several Counties and Corporations in this Colony,
for the use of the Delegates sent to represent this Colony in
General Congress.</b></p>

<p>Adjourned till Monday, 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>March 27 ... <i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That from and after
the first day of <i>May</i> next, no person or persons whatever
ought to use, in his or their families, unless in case of necessity,
and on no account to sell to butchers, or kill for market,
any Sheep under four years old; and where there is necessity
for using any mutton in his, her, or their families, it is recommended
to kill such only as are least profitable to be kept.</p>

<p><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That the setting up and promoting
Woollen, Cotton, and Linen Manufactures ought to be encouraged
in as many different branches as possible, especially
Coating, Flannel, Blankets, Rugs, or Coverlids, Hosiery, and
coarse Cloths, both broad and narrow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, As Salt is a daily and indispensable
necessary of life, and the making of it amongst ourselves must
be deemed a valuable acquisition, it is therefore recommended
that the utmost endeavours be used to establish Salt Works,
and that proper encouragement be given to Mr. <i>James Tait</i>,
who hath made proposals, and offered a scheme to the publick,
for so desirable a purpose.</p>

<p><b><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That Saltpetre and Sulphur, <i>being articles
of great and necessary use</i>, the making, collecting, and refining
them to the utmost extent, be recommended, the Convention being
of opinion that it may be done to great advantage.</b></p>

<p><b><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That the making of Gunpowder be recommended.</b></p>

<p><b><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That the manufacturing of iron into Nails
and Wire, and other necessary articles, be recommended.</b></p>

<p><b><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That the making of Steel ought to be
largely encouraged, as there will be a great demand for this
article.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That the making of different kinds
of Paper ought to be encouraged; and as the success of this
branch depends on a supply of old Linen and Woollen Rags,
the inhabitants of this Colony are desired, in their respective
families, to preserve these articles.</p>

<p><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That whereas Wool Combs, Cotton
and Wool Cards, Hemp and Flax Heckles, have been for some
time made to advantage in some of the neighbouring Colonies,
and are necessary for carrying on Linen and Woollen Manufactures,
the establishing such Manufactures be recommended.</p>

<p><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That the erecting Fulling Mills and
mills for breaking, swingling, and softening Hemp and Flax,
and also the making Grindstones be recommended.</p>

<p><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That the brewing Malt Liquors in this
Colony would tend to render the consumption of foreign
Liquors less necessary. It is therefore recommended that
proper attention be given to the cultivation of Hops and
Barley.</p>

<p><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That it be recommended to all the
inhabitants of this Colony, that they use, as the Convention
engageth to do, our own Manufactures, and those of other
Colonies, in preference to all others.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Members of the Convention then, in order to encourage
Mr. <i>James Tait</i>, who is about to erect Salt Works, undertook,
for their respective Counties, to pay the sum of Ten Pounds
to <i>Robert Carter Nicholas</i>, Esquire, for the use of the said
<i>James Tait</i>, on or before the 10th day of <i>May</i> next.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b><i>Resolved</i>, That this Convention doth consider the delegation of
its members as now at an end; and that it is recommended to the
People of this Colony to choose Delegates to represent them in
Convention <i>for one year</i>, as soon as they conveniently can.</b></p>

<h5><i>c.</i> [<i>The Third Virginia Convention</i>, pursuant to the call in the closing
recommendation of the Second, met July 17, 1775, and adopted the forms
of a legislative body, giving bills three readings, etc. The first resolution
read. ...</h5>

<p>"That this Convention will observe, in their debates <i>and proceedings</i>,
the same Rules and Orders as are established in the House of Burgesses
of this Colony." Cf. with the corresponding Resolution of the Second
Convention above; note significance of the two additional words. That
significance is brought out clearly in the postscript of a letter from George
Mason to a friend, August 22:</p>

<p>"P. S. Every ordinance goes thro' all the Formalities of a Bill in the
House of Burgesses, has three Readings, etc. before it is passed, and in
every respect wears the Face of Law,&mdash;Resolves, as recommendations,
being no longer trusted to. ..." (Virginia Calendar of State Papers, I,
269.)</p>

<p>Thus the Third Convention was a "government" in style as well as
in fact. It held two busy sessions; and, in January, 1776, though its
"year" was not up, it adjourned, to give place to a new Convention
freshly instructed from the people.]</p></div>

he had intended to present such a resolution in the Assembly, but, on advice
of friends, waited for the completion of important business,&mdash;and then came
the dissolution. Washington went from this meeting, over which he had
presided, to dine with Lord and Lady Dunmore. The tone of Virginia intercourse

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_123" id="Footnote_123"></a><a href="#FNanchor_123"><span class="label">[123]</span></a> This final clause refers to a provision withdrawing from trial in colonial
courts any servants of the government accused of violence in the performance
of duty. The list of offending statutes is repeated, somewhat less impressively
but more specifically, in the Continental Congress's <b>Declaration</b> (130 <i>c</i>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_124" id="Footnote_124"></a><a href="#FNanchor_124"><span class="label">[124]</span></a> Upon this passage was based the Sixth Article of the Virginia Association,
recommended August 1, by the Convention as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"6th. We will endeavor to improve our breed of sheep, and increase their
number to the utmost extent; and to this end, we will be as sparing as we
conveniently can, in killing sheep, especially those of the most profitable
kind; and if we should at any time be overstocked, or can conveniently
spare any, we will dispose of them to our neighbors, especially the poorer
sort of people, on moderate terms."</p>
<p>In time, this passage was copied even more closely in the Association of
the Continental Congress at Philadelphia (No. 130 <i>d</i>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_125" id="Footnote_125"></a><a href="#FNanchor_125"><span class="label">[125]</span></a> This resolution is found in identical words in the resolutions of Caroline
County (Virginia), July 14, 1774; and the sentiment, in more varied forms,
appears often in the county meetings. Thus Hanover (Patrick Henry's
county) declared: "The African trade for slaves we consider most dangerous
to virtue and the welfare of this country. We therefore most earnestly wish
to see it totally discouraged."</p></div>

<p>Force, <i>American Archives</i>, Fourth Series, V, 1034-1035.</p>

<p>The following instructions from a county meeting of Charlotte County,
Virginia, to delegates for the next Virginia Convention [to meet May 6]
show that that body was at least partially authorized to take its momentous
action of adopting a State constitution and of instructing the Virginia delegates
at Philadelphia to move for independence. Note that the King,
to whom all earlier documents had professed loyalty, is here coupled with
the ministry and parliament. Other counties gave similar instruction.
Cf. Force, V, 1046.</p></div>

<p><i>To Paul Carrington, and Thomas Read, Esq's.:</i></p>

<p>Gentlemen: When we consider the despotick plan adopted by
the King, Ministry and Parliament of <i>Great Britain</i>, insidiously
pursued for these twelve years past, to enslave <i>America</i>; when
we consider that they have turned a deaf ear to the repeated
petitions and remonstrances of this and our sister Colonies,
and that they have been equally inattentive to the rights of
freemen and the British Constitution; and when we consider
that they have for some time been endeavouring to enforce
their arbitrary mandates by fire and sword, and likewise
encouraging, by every means in their power, our savage neighbours,
and our more savage domestics, to spill the blood
of our wives and children; and to crown the whole, they have
added insult to their injustice and cruelty, by repeatedly pretending
to hold out the olive branch of peace in such a way as
teacheth us that they are determined to persist in their hellish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
designs, and that nothing is intended for us but the most
abject slavery....</p>

<p>Therefore despairing of any redress of our grievances from the
King and Parliament of <i>Great Britain</i>, and all hopes of a reconciliation
between her and the United Colonies being now at an
end, and being concious that their treatment has been such as
loyal subjects did not deserve, and to which as freemen, we are
determined not to submit; by the unanimous approbation and
direction of the whole freeholders, and all the other inhabitants
of this County, we advise and instruct you, cheerfully to concur
and give your best assistance in our Convention, to push to the
utmost a war offensive and defensive until you are certified that
such proposals of peace are made to our General Congress as shall
by them be judged just and friendly. And because the advantages
of a trade will better enable us to pay the taxes, and procure
the necessaries for carrying on a war, and in our present circumstances
this cannot be had without a Declaration of Independence;
therefore, if no such proposals of peace shall be
made, we judge it to be a dictate of the first law of nature, to
continue to oppose every attempt on our lives and properties;
and we give it you in charge, to use your best endeavours
<b>that the Delegates which are sent to the General Congress be instructed
immediately to cast off the <i>British</i> yoke</b>, and to enter into
a commercial alliance with any nation or nations friendly to
our cause. And as King George the Third of Great Britain
etc., has manifested deliberate enmity towards us, and under
the character of a parent persists in behaving as a tyrant, that
they, in our behalf renounce allegiance to him for ever; <b>and
that, taking God of Heaven to be our King, and depending upon
His protection and assistance, they plan out that form of Government
which may the more effectually secure to us the enjoyment
of our civil and religious rights and privileges, to the latest posterity. ...</b></p>

<p>Ordered, That the above Resolves be published in the <i>Virginian
Gazette</i>.</p>

Resolutions for an Independent State Government), May 15, 1776<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Force, <i>American Archives</i>, Fourth Series, VI, 461-462.</p>

<p>The Fourth Virginia Convention met May 6, elected on the recommendation
of the preceding Convention (see No. 133 c, close). On the 9th the
Convention voted to go next day into Committee of the Whole to consider
the state of the colony (which meant to take up the matter of
independence and a State government). Military needs, however, delayed
the consideration until the 14th. On that day and the 15th, the questions
were debated, and, on the 15th, the Committee rose and reported to the
Convention the resolutions below, which were unanimously adopted. For
a more detailed story, see <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 148; but
it should be seen here clearly that the Convention instructed its delegates
in the Continental Congress to secure a <i>general</i> declaration of Independence
for all the colonies, and that, at the same time, it began the work of a
permanent independent constitution for Virginia.</p></div>

<p>[The first half of the document is a preamble stating the
grievances of the colonies.] ... In this state of extreme
danger, we have no alternative left but an abject submission
to the will of those overbearing tyrants or a total separation
from the crown and government of Great Britain, uniting and
exerting the strength of all America for defence, and forming
alliances with foreign powers for commerce and aid in war:
Wherefore, appealing to the Searcher of Hearts for the sincerity
of former declarations expressing our desire to preserve
the connection with that nation, and that we are driven from
that inclination by their wicked councils and the eternal laws
of self-preservation;</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, unanimously, That the delegates appointed to
represent this colony in General Congress be instructed to
propose to that respectable body to declare the United Colonies
free and independent States, absolved from all allegiance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>to or dependence upon the Crown or parliament of Great
Britain; and that they give the assent of this colony to such
declaration, and to whatever measures may be thought proper
and necessary by the Congress for forming foreign alliances
and a confederation of the colonies, at such time, and in such
manner, as to them shall seem best: Provided that the power
of forming government for, and the regulation of, the internal
concerns of each colony, be left to the respective colonial
legislatures.</p>

<p><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That a committee be appointed to
prepare a <span class="smcap">Declaration of Rights</span> and such a plan of government
as will be most likely to maintain peace and order in
this colony, and secure substantial and equal liberty to the
people.</p>


<h4>136. The Virginia Bill of Rights, June 12, 1776</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Poore, <i>Charters and Constitutions</i>, II, 1908-1909. Cf. No. 135 for
history. This bill of rights was reported by a committee to the Virginia
Convention on May 27, and adopted unanimously on June 12. It was
the model, often followed closely, for similar bills in other states. See
comment at close.</p></div>

<p><i>A declaration of rights made by the representatives of the good
people of Virginia, assembled in full and free convention; which
rights do pertain to them and their posterity, as the basis and
foundation of government.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> That all men are by nature equally free and
independent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when
they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact,
deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of
life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing
property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 2.</span> That all power is vested in, and consequently
derived from, the people; that magistrates are their trustees
and servants, and at all times amenable to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 3.</span> That government is, or ought to be, instituted
for the common benefit, protection, and security of the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
nation, or community; of all the various modes and forms of
government, that is best which is capable of producing the
greatest degree of happiness and safety, and is most effectually
secured against the danger of maladministration; and that,
when any government shall be found inadequate or contrary
to these purposes, a majority of the community hath an indubitable,
inalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter,
or abolish it in such manner as shall be judged most conducive
to the public weal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 4.</span> That no man, or set of men, are entitled to exclusive
or separate emoluments or privileges from the community,
but in consideration of public services; which, not being
descendible, neither ought the offices of magistrate, legislator,
or judge to be hereditary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 5.</span> That the legislative and executive powers of
the State should be separate and distinct from the judiciary;
and that the members of the two first may be restrained from
oppression, by feeling and participating in the burdens of the
people, they should, at fixed periods, be reduced to a private
station, return into that body from which they were originally
taken, and the vacancies be supplied by frequent, certain, and
regular elections, in which all, or any part of the former members
to be again eligible, or ineligible, as the laws shall direct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 6.</span> That elections of members to serve as representatives
of the people, in assembly, ought to be free; and that
all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest
with, and attachment to, the community, have the right
of suffrage, and cannot be taxed or deprived of their property
for public uses, without their own consent, or that of their representatives
so elected, nor bound by any law to which they
have not, in like manner, assented, for the public good.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Section 7.</span> That all power of suspending laws, or the execution
of laws, by any authority, without consent of the representatives
of the people, is injurious to their rights, and ought
not to be exercised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 8.</span> That in all capital or criminal prosecutions a
man hath a right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation,
to be confronted with the accusers and witnesses, to call
for evidence in his favor, and to a speedy trial by an impartial
jury of twelve men of his vicinage, without whose unanimous
consent he cannot be found guilty; nor can he be compelled to
give evidence against himself; that no man be deprived of his
liberty, except by the law of the land or the judgment of his peers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 9.</span> That excessive bail ought not to be required,
nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments
inflicted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 10.</span> That general warrants, whereby an officer or
messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without
evidence of a fact committed, or to seize any person or
persons not named, or whose offence is not particularly described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>and supported by evidence, are grievous and oppressive,
and ought not to be granted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 11.</span> That in controversies respecting property, and
in suits between man and man, the ancient trial by jury is preferable
to any other, and ought to be held sacred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 12.</span> That the freedom of the press is one of the
great bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by
despotic governments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 13.</span> That a well-regulated militia, composed of the
body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and
safe defence of a free State; that standing armies, in time of
peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty; and that in
all cases the military should be under strict subordination to,
and governed by, the civil power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 14.</span> That the people have a right to uniform government;
and, therefore, that no government separate from, or
independent of the government of Virginia, ought to be erected
or established within the limits thereof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 15.</span> That no free government, or the blessings of
liberty, can be preserved to any people, but by a firm adherence
to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue,
and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 16.</span> That religion, or the duty which we owe to
our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed
only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and
therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of
religion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is
the mutual duty of all to practise Christian forbearance, love
and charity towards each other.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>[The failure of historians to give due credit to this bill of
rights is remarkable. I call attention to two illustrations.</p>

<p>(1) Cushing's <i>Transition from Provincial to Commonwealth
Government in Massachusetts</i> (Columbia University Studies, VII,
1896) states incorrectly (p. 246, note 1) that the constitution
of Virginia contained no preamble (cf. No. 137 below): and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
on page 247 and notes, it quotes precedents from the Maryland
bill of rights instead of from the Virginia document from
which the Maryland statement was taken; while page 248,
in referring to "others [than Massachusetts that] realized
keenly the vital importance of a clear and abiding statement
of the immunities and privileges of man in civil society," adds
the note: "A Declaration of Rights was adopted by Delaware,
Maryland, New Hampshire (1784), North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
Vermont, <i>and</i> Virginia" (!) The order of statement
is ingeniously misleading. All the others named drew mainly
from the one named last.</p>

<p>(2) Merriam's <i>History of American Political Theories</i> (1902)
contains several such misleading statements. On page 49, to
illustrate the fact that some State constitutions (as well as the
Declaration of Independence) asserted the doctrine of "inalienable
rights," including "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"
reference is made in detail to the New Hampshire bill
of rights (eight years later than the Declaration), but not
at all to the Virginia bill of rights, which preceded the
Continental Declaration. So, too, especially on page 153, a
footnote is inserted expressly to show how the idea of "frequent
recurrence to fundamental principles" was often expressed
in Revolutionary State constitutions, as follows:
"Massachusetts (1780), Art. 18; Pennsylvania (1776), Art. 14;
New Hampshire, Art. 38; North Carolina, Art. 21; Vermont,
Art. 16." Would it not have been well to recognize in such
a list the State in whose constitution the phrase was first
used?]</p>


<h4>137. The First Declaration of Independence by a State</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Preamble to the Virginia Constitution, June 29, 1776</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Virginia constitution, adopted on June 29, 1776, consisted of
three parts: (1) a declaration of independence; (2) the bill of rights;
(3) the frame of government. The original intention (No. 135, close)
had been to include the last two only, and to leave the declaration of
independence to Congress. But on June 24, when the convention had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>nearly completed its consideration of the constitution, it received from
Jefferson a draft of a constitution prefaced by a declaration of independence.
Of the adoption of this preface, Jefferson wrote in 1825:</p>

<p>"I was then at Philadelphia ... knowing that the Convention of
Virginia was engaged in forming a plan of government, I turned my
mind to the same subject, and drew a sketch ... of a Constitution with
a preamble, which I sent to Mr. Pendleton, president of the Convention
... He informed me ... that he received it on the day on which the
Committee of the Whole had reported to the House the plan they had
agreed to; and that it had been so long in hand, so disputed inch by
inch ... that they were worried with the contentions it had produced,
and could not, from mere lassitude, have been induced to open the instrument
again; but that, being pleased with the Preamble to mine, they
adopted it in the House, by way of amendment to the report of the
committee [June 29]; and thus my Preamble was tacked to the work of
George Mason, ... <i>The Preamble was prior in composition to the
Declaration</i> [of July 4]."<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p></div>

<p>Whereas George Guelf, king of Great Britain ... and
heretofore entrusted with the exercise of the kingly office in
this government [Virginia], hath endeavored to pervert the
same into a detestable and insupportable tyranny:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>by putting his negative on laws the most wholesome
and necessary for the public good;</p>

<p>by ... [21 indictments follow&mdash;similar to the
charges in the Declaration soon after adopted
at Philadelphia] by which several acts of
mis-rule the said George Guelf has forfeited the
kingly office, and has rendered it necessary for the
preservation of the people that he should be immediately
deposed from the same....</p></div>

<p>Be it therefore enacted by the authority of the people that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
the said George Guelf be, and he hereby is deposed from the
kingly office within this government, and absolutely divested
of all its rights, powers, and prerogatives: and that he and
his descendants, and all persons acting by or through him, and
all other persons whatsoever, shall be and forever remain
incapable of the same: and that the said office shall henceforth
cease, and never more either in name or substance be reestablished
within this colony.</p>

<h5><i>a. Recommendation of Congress, May 15, 1776</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Journals of Congress</i> (Ford edition), V, 357 ff.</p></div>

<p>IN CONGRESS, May 15, 1776.</p>

<p><i>Whereas</i>, his Britannic majesty, in conjunction with the lords
and commons of Great Britain, has, by a late act of parliament,
excluded the inhabitants of these united colonies from the
protection of his crown&mdash;And whereas no answer whatever
to the humble petitions of the colonies for redress of grievances
and reconciliation with Great Britain, has been, or is
likely to be given, but the whole force of that kingdom, aided
by foreign mercenaries, is to be exerted for the destruction
of the good people of these colonies&mdash;and whereas it appears
absolutely irreconcilable to reason and good conscience, for
the people of these colonies NOW to take the oaths and
affirmations necessary for the support of any government
under the crown of Great Britain; <b>and it is necessary that the
exercise of every kind of authority under the said crown should be
totally suppressed, and all the powers of government exerted under
the authority of the people of the colonies</b>, for the preservation of
internal peace, virtue, and good order, as well as for the
defence of their lives, liberties and properties, against the
hostile invasions and cruel depredations of their enemies&mdash;Therefore,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></p>

<p><b><i>Resolved</i>, That it be recommended to the respective assemblies,
and conventions, of the united colonies, where no government sufficient
to the exigencies of their affairs has been heretofore established,
to adopt such government as shall, in the opinion of the representatives
of the people, best conduce to the happiness and safety of their
constituents in particular, and America in general.</b></p>


<h5><i>b. John Adams' Comment upon the Bearing of that Action
(<span class="antiqua">a</span> above) upon Independence</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Letters of John Adams to His Wife</i>, I, 109-111. Adams had been
the special champion of the action finally recommended by Congress as
above. On the following Sunday, he wrote as follows of that memorable
action, and of the earlier action in South Carolina in adopting a <i>temporary</i>
government of its own.</p></div>

<p class="center"><i>John Adams to Abigail Adams</i></p>

<p class="right">Philadelphia, May 17, 1776.</p>

<p>I have this morning heard Mr. Duffield, upon the signs of
the times. ... He concluded, that the course of events
indicated strongly the design of Providence, that we should
be separated from Great Britain, etc....</p>

<p>Is it not a saying of Moses, "who am I, that I should go in
and out before this great people?" When I consider the
great events which are passed, and those greater which are
rapidly advancing, and that I may have been instrumental
in touching some springs, and turning some small wheels,
which have had and will have such effects, I feel an awe upon
my mind, which is not easily described. Great Britain has
at last driven America to the last step, a complete separation
from her; a total absolute independence, not only of her
Parliament, but of her crown, <i>for such is the amount of the
resolve of the 15th. Confederation among ourselves, or alliances
with foreign nations, are not necessary to a perfect separation
from Britain. That is effected by extinguishing all authority
under the crown, Parliament, and nation, as the resolution for
instituting governments has done, to all intents and purposes.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
Confederation will be necessary for our internal concord, and
alliances may be so for our external defence.</p>

<p><i>I have reasons to believe that no colony, which shall assume a
government under the people, will give it up.</i> There is something
very unnatural and odious in a government a thousand leagues
off. A whole government of our own choice, managed by
persons whom we love, revere, and can confide in, has charms
in it, for which men will fight. Two young gentlemen from
South Carolina in this city, who were in Charlestown when
their new constitution was promulgated, and when their new
Governor and Council and Assembly walked out in procession,
attended by the guards, company of cadets, light horse, etc.,
told me, that they were beheld by the people with transports
and tears of joy. The people gazed at them with a kind of
rapture. They both told me, that the reflection, that these
were gentlemen whom they all loved, esteemed and revered,
gentlemen of their own choice, whom they could trust, and
whom they could displace, if any of them should behave
amiss, affected them so, that they could not help crying.
<i>They say, their people will never give up this government. ...</i></p>

Jr., Robert Goldsborough, William Paca, Samuel Chase, Thomas
Stone, Robert Alexander, and John Rogers, Esquires.</p>

<p>The convention taking into their most serious consideration
the present state of the unhappy dispute between Great Britain
and the united colonies, think it proper to deliver you their
sentiments, and to instruct you in certain points, relative to
your conduct in congress, as representatives of this province.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>

<p>The experience we and our ancestors have had of the mildness
and equity of the English constitution, under which we
have grown up to and enjoyed a state of felicity, not exceeded
among any people we know of, until the grounds of the present
controversy were laid by the ministry and parliament of Great
Britain, has most strongly endeared to us that form of government
from whence these blessings have been derived, and makes
us ardently wish for a reconciliation with the mother country,
upon terms that may insure to these colonies an equal and permanent
freedom.</p>

<p>To this constitution we are attached, not merely by habit, but
by principle, being in our judgments persuaded [that] it is of
all known systems best calculated to secure the liberty of the
subject, to guard against despotism on the one hand, and licentiousness
on the other.</p>

<p>Impressed with these sentiments, we warmly recommend to
you, to keep constantly in your view the avowed end and purpose
for which these colonies originally associated,&mdash;the redress
of American grievances and [the] securing the rights of the
colonists.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We further instruct you, <b><i>that you do not without the previous
knowledge and approbation of the convention of this province, assent
to any proposition to declare these colonies independent of the crown
of Great Britain, nor to any proposition for making or entering into
alliance with any foreign power, nor to any union or confederation of
these colonies</i></b>, which may necessarily lead to a separation from
the mother country, unless in your judgments of any four of
you, or of a majority of the whole of you, if all shall be then
attending in congress, it shall be thought absolutely necessary
for the preservation of the liberties of the united colonies; and
<b><i>should a majority of the colonies in congress, against such your judgment,
resolve to declare these colonies independent of the crown of
Great Britain, or to make or enter into alliance with any foreign power,
or into any union or confederation of these colonies, which may neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>sarily
lead to a separation from the mother country, then we instruct
you immediately to call the convention of this province, and repair thereto
with such proposition and resolve, and lay the same before the said
convention, for their consideration, and this convention will not hold
this province bound by such majority in congress, until the representative
body of the province in convention assent thereto.</i></b></p>

<p>Desirous as we are of peace with Great Britain upon safe and
honourable terms, we wish you nevertheless, and instruct you

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The convention took into their consideration the report from
the committee appointed to report on the resolution of congress
of the 15th instant, and thereupon came to the following
resolutions.</p>

<p><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That the people of this province have
the sole and exclusive right of regulating the internal government
and police of this province.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That this province has hitherto exerted
itself, and will upon all occasions continue to exert itself, with
cheerfulness and alacrity, in the common cause, agreeable to the
faith pledged in the union of the colonies: and <i>if it shall appear
to this province</i> necessary to enter into a further compact for the
preservation of the constitutional rights of America, this province
will enter into such further engagement for that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That this convention, by a resolution
of the 15th day of this instant, hath made sufficient provision
to prevent a necessity for any person within this province now
taking the oaths for the support of government under the crown
of Great Britain, and that it is the opinion of this convention,
that <b><i>it is not necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority
under the said crown should be now totally suppressed</i></b> in this province,
and all the powers of government exerted under the
authority of the people.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That as this convention is firmly persuaded
that a re-union with Great Britain on constitutional
principles would most effectually secure the rights and liberties,
and increase the strength and promote the happiness of the
whole empire, objects which this province hath ever had in
view, <b><i>the said deputies are bound and directed to govern themselves by

particularly repeated</i></b>.</p>

<p>[These instructions continued in force until revoked on <i>June</i>

<p>(3) <i>Resolved unanimously</i>, That the instructions given by the
convention of December last (and renewed by the convention in
May) to the deputies of this colony in Congress be recalled, and
the restrictions therein contained removed; and that the deputies
of this colony attending in Congress ... be authorized

<h4>140. Motion in Congress for Independence</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Journals of Congress</i>, V, 425. In obedience to the instructions from
the Virginia Convention, Richard Henry Lee, on June 7, moved in Congress
the following resolutions. After delays, to permit certain delegates
to secure permission for their colonial assemblies, the resolution
was finally adopted July 2, by the vote of all colonies but New York. For
further detail, cf. <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 150.</p></div>

<p>That these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free
and independent States; that they are absolved from all
allegiance to the British Crown; and that all political connection
between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought
to be, totally dissolved.</p>

<p>That it is expedient forthwith to take the most effectual
measures for forming foreign alliances.</p>

<p>That a plan of confederation be prepared and transmitted to
the respective colonies for their consideration.</p>


<h4>141. The Continental Declaration of Independence</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>While the debate was proceeding on Lee's resolutions (No. 140), to save
time, in case those resolutions should be adopted, Congress appointed a
committee (Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger
Sherman, and R. R. Livingston) to draft a full "Declaration of Independence."
Jefferson, the member from the colony which had moved the
resolution,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> was naturally made chairman and drew the document, which
with slight modification was presented to Congress on June 28. After the
adoption of the resolutions on July 2, this formal Declaration was taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>up by Congress, considered on the 2d, 3d, and 4th of July, and passed.
August 2, a copy, engrossed on parchment, was signed by the members of
Congress there present. Other signatures were added later until all
thirteen States were represented. The following capitalization, paragraphing,
and punctuation follow the original parchment.</p></div>

                        States of America</span></p>

<p><span class="antiqua">When</span> in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary
for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected
them with another, and to assume among the powers of the
earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of
Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to
the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the
causes which impel them to the separation.&mdash;We hold these
truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that
they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
Happiness.&mdash;That to secure these rights, Governments are
instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed.&mdash;That whenever any Form of
Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the
Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute
new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and
organizing its powers in such forms, as to them shall seem
most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence,
indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should
not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly
all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to
suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves
by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing
invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
for their future security.&mdash;Such has been the patient sufferance
of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity
which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.
The history of the present King of Great Britain is a
history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct
object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these
States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.&mdash;He
has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and
necessary for the public good.&mdash;He has forbidden his Governors
to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless
suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained;
and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to
attend to them.&mdash;He has refused to pass other Laws for
the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those
people would relinquish the right of Representation in the
Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to
tyrants only.&mdash;He has called together legislative bodies at
places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository
of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing
them into compliance with his measures.&mdash;He has
dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing
with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the
people.&mdash;He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions,
to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative
Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the
People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in
the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from
without, and convulsions within.&mdash;He has endeavoured to
prevent the population of these States; for that purpose
obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners;
refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither,
and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.&mdash;He
has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing
his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary
Powers.&mdash;He has made Judges dependent on his will
alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
payment of their salaries.&mdash;He has erected a multitude of
New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass
our People, and eat out their substance.&mdash;He has kept
among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the
Consent of our legislature.&mdash;He has affected to render
the Military independent of and superior to the Civil
Power.&mdash;He has combined with others to subject us to a
jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged
by our laws; giving his Assent to their acts of pretended
legislation:&mdash;For quartering large bodies of armed troops
among us:&mdash;For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from
Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on
the Inhabitants of these States:&mdash;For cutting off our Trade
with all parts of the world:&mdash;For imposing taxes on us
without our Consent:&mdash;For depriving us in many cases, of
the benefits of Trial by Jury:&mdash;For transporting us beyond
Seas to be tried for pretended offence:&mdash;For abolishing the
free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province,
establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging
its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit
instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these
Colonies:&mdash;For taking away our Charters, abolishing our
most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms
of our Governments:&mdash;For suspending our own Legislature,
and declaring themselves invested with Power to legislate
for us in all cases whatsoever.&mdash;He has abdicated Government
here, by declaring us out of his Protection and
waging War against us.&mdash;He has plundered our seas,
ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives
of our people.&mdash;He is at this time transporting large armies
of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death,
desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances
of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous
ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized
nation.&mdash;He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken
Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>try,
to become executioners of their friends and Brethren,
or to fall themselves by their Hands.&mdash;He has excited
domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to
bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian
Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished
destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every
stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress
in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have
been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose
character is thus marked by every act which may define a
Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have
We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren.
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by
their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction
over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of
our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to
their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured
them by the ties of common kindred to disavow these
usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections
and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the
voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore,
acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation,
and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies
in War, in Peace Friends.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="antiqua">We, therefore,</span> the Representatives of the <span class="antiqua">united States of
America</span>, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the
Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions,

That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be,
<span class="antiqua">free and Independent States</span>; that they are Absolved from
all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political

to do all other Acts and Things which <span class="smcap">Independent

with a firm reliance on the protection of divine
Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives,
our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From "Passages from an Autobiography" in John Adams' <i>Works</i> (II,

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An event of the most trifling nature in appearance, and fit
only to excite laughter in other times, struck me into a profound
reverie, if not a fit of melancholy. I met a man who
had sometimes been my client, and sometimes I had been
against him. He, though a common horse-jockey, was sometimes
in the right, and I had commonly been successful in his
favor in our courts of law. He was always in the law, and
had been sued in many actions at almost every court. As
soon as he saw me, he came up to me, and his first salutation
to me was, "Oh! Mr. Adams, what great things have you and
your colleagues done for us! We can never be grateful enough
to you. There are no courts of justice now in this Province
and I hope there never will be another." Is this the object
for which I have been contending? said I to myself, for I
rode along without any answer to this wretch. Are these
the sentiments of such people, and how many of them are
there in the country? Half the nation, for what I know;
for half the nation are debtors, if not more, and these have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
been, in all countries, the sentiments of debtors. If the
power of the country should get into such hands, and there is
great danger that it will, to what purpose have we sacrificed
our time, health and every thing else? Surely we must guard
against this spirit and these principles, or we shall repent of
all our conduct. However, the good sense and integrity of the
majority of the great body of the people came into my thoughts,
for my relief, and the last resource was after all in a good
Providence.</p>

<p>I acknowledge to have wrote a piece, and did not sign it, since
said to be an extract of a letter from Kent county, on Delaware,
published in Humphreys' Ledger, No. 3. It was not dated from
any place, and is some altered from the original. I folded it
up and directed the same to J. F. and Sons. I had no intention
to have it published; and further, I let them know the
author thought best it should not be published; nor did I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
think they would.&mdash;I am sincerely sorry I ever wrote it, as
also for its being published, and hope I shall be excused for
this, my first breach in this way, and I intend it shall be
the last.</p>

<p class="right">R. H.</p>

<p><i>To the committee of correspondence for Kent county, on Delaware.
May 2d, 1775.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir.</span>&mdash;The president of the committee of correspondence, by
and with the advice of such other of the members of that committee
as he was able to collect and consult, this day laid before
the committee of inspection for this county, your letter
wherein you confess yourself to be the author of the Kentish
letter (commonly so called) published in 3d No. of Humphreys'
Ledger.</p>

<p>The committee took the same into consideration, and have
unanimously resolved that it is unsatisfactory, and you are
requested to attend the committee at their next meeting on
Tuesday the 9th inst. at French Battell's, in Dover and render
such satisfaction to the committee, as will enable them to clear
the good people of this county from the aspersions of that letter,
and justify them in the eyes of the public.</p>

<p>Signed by order of the committee.</p>

<p><i>To R. H.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen.</span>&mdash;With sorrow and contrition for my weakness
and folly, I confess myself the author of the letter, from
which an extract was published in the 3d No. of Humphreys'
Ledger, said to be from Kent county, on Delaware; but at the
same time to declare it was published without my consent,
and not without some alterations.</p>

<p>I am now convinced that the political sentiments therein
contained, were founded on the grossest error; more especially
that malignant insinuation, that "if the king's standard were
now erected, nine out of ten would repair to it," could not
have been suggested, but from the deepest infatuation. True<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
indeed it is, the people of this county have ever shewn a
zealous attachment to his majesty's person and government,
and whenever he raised his standard in a just cause, were
ready to flock to it: but let the severe account I now render to
an injured people, witness to the world, that none are more
ready to oppose tyranny or to be first in the cause of liberty,
than the inhabitants of Kent county.</p>

<p>Conscious that I can render no satisfaction adequate to the
injury I have done my country, I can only beg the forgiveness
of my countrymen, upon those principles of humanity, which
may induce them to consider the frailty of human nature&mdash;and
I do profess and promise, that I will never again oppose
those laudable measures, necessarily adopted by my countrymen,
for the preservation of American freedom: but will cooperate
with them to the utmost of my abilities, in their
virtuous struggle for liberty (so far as is consistent with my
religious principles).</p>

then be the condition in America under French rule.</p></div>

<p>Boston, November 10, 1789.&mdash;His Excellency, Count Tyran,
has this day published, by authority from his majesty, a proclamation
for the suppression of heresy and establishment of the
inquisition in this town, which has already begun its functions
in many other places of the continent under his majesty's
dominion.</p>

<p>The use of the Bible in the vulgar tongue is strictly
prohibited, on pain of being punished by discretion of the
inquisition.</p>

<p>November 11.&mdash;The Catholic religion is not only outwardly
professed, but has made the utmost progress among all ranks
of people here, owing, in a great measure, to the unwearied
labors of the Dominican and Franciscan friars, who omit no
opportunity of scattering the seeds of religion, and converting
the wives and daughters of heretics. We hear that the building
formerly called the Old South Meeting, is fitting up for a
cathedral, and that several other old meeting-houses are soon
to be repaired for convents.</p>

<p>November 12.&mdash;This day being Sunday, the famous Samuel
Adams read his recantation of heresy, after which he was
present at mass, and we hear he will soon receive priest's orders
to qualify him for a member of the American Sorbonne....</p>

<p>The king has been pleased to order that five thousand of the
inhabitants of Massachusetts Bay should be drafted to supply
his garrisons in the West Indies; the officers for them are
already arrived from France.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>New York, November 15.&mdash;The edict for prohibiting the
use of the English language, and establishing that of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
in all law proceedings, will take place on the 20th instant. At
the same time, the ordinance for abolishing trials by juries,
and introducing the imperial law, will begin to take effect....</p>

<p>November 17.&mdash;A criminal of importance, who has been
long imprisoned in the New Bastille, was this day privately
beheaded. He commanded the American forces against Great
Britain for a considerable time, but was confined by order of
the government on suspicion of possessing a dangerous influence
in a country newly conquered, and not thoroughly settled.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>...</p>

<p>The king has been pleased to parcel out a great part of the
lands in America to noblemen of distinction, who will grant
them again to the peasantry upon leases at will, with the
reservation of proper rents and services.</p>

<p>His majesty has been graciously pleased to order that none
of the natives of America shall keep any firearms in their
possession, upon pain of being sentenced to the galleys....</p>

<p>November 22.&mdash;We hear from Williamsburg, in Virginia,
that some commotions took place there when the new capitation
tax was first executed. But the regiment of Bretagne,
being stationed in that neighborhood, speedily suppressed
them by firing upon the populace, and killing fifty on the spot.
It is hoped that this example will prevent any future insurrection
in that part of the country.</p>

<p>November 23.&mdash;His majesty has directed his viceroy to send
five hundred sons of the principal inhabitants of America, to be
educated in France, where the utmost care will be taken to
imbue them with a regard for the Catholic faith, and a due
sense of subordination to government.</p>

Dr. Ramsey was a citizen of South Carolina.</p></div>

<p>When the war began, the Americans were a mass of husbandmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
merchants, mechanics, and fishermen; but the
necessities of the country gave a <i>spring</i> to the active powers of
the inhabitants, and set them on thinking, speaking, and
acting, in a line far beyond that to which they had been
accustomed. The difference between nations is not so much
owing to nature, as to education and circumstances. While
the Americans were guided by the leading strings of the
mother country, they had no scope nor encouragement for
exertion. All the departments of government were established
and executed <i>for</i> them, but not <i>by</i> them. In the years 1775
and 1776, the country, being suddenly thrown into a situation
that needed the abilities of all its sons, these generally took
their places, each according to the bent of his inclination. As
they severally pursued their objects with ardor, <i>a vast expansion
of the human mind speedily followed</i>. This displayed itself in
a variety of ways. It was found that the talents for great
stations did not differ in kind, but only in degree, from those
which were necessary for the proper discharge of the ordinary
business of civil society....</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_131" id="Footnote_131"></a><a href="#FNanchor_131"><span class="label">[131]</span></a> The sixth article seems to have been designed by George Mason, who
drew it, as an argument for extending the franchise to heads of families.
Mason drew also a plan for the <i>frame of government</i>, which the convention
in the main adopted on <i>June 29</i>. In this plan he proposed to "extend" the
franchise to leaseholders with seven-year terms, and to any "housekeeper"
who was also the father of three children (Article V of Mason's Plan; printed
in full in Kate Mason Rowland's <i>Life and Correspondence of George Mason</i>,
I, 444 ff.). The convention, however, left the franchise as "now established
by law"&mdash;on a freehold basis (<i>American History and Government</i>, &sect;&sect; 105,
107). Mason, in his plan, suggested graded landed qualifications for holding
office: &pound;500 freehold to act as a member of his proposed electoral college to
choose state senators; &pound;1000 freehold to sit in the lower House; &pound;2000 freehold
to sit in the upper House.</p>
<p>It is often said that Mason proposed a &pound;1000-freehold qualification for the
franchise. The language of Section III of his "plan," <i>taken by itself</i>, would so
indicate. But the clauses III and IV are very loosely worded and punctuated;
and, when they are read in conjunction with Section V, the only possible conclusion
is the one stated above. In proposing so liberal a franchise, however,
Mason stood alone in Virginia in his day. Even Jefferson's plan for a Virginia
constitution called for "a freehold of &frac14; of an acre of land in a town, or
25 acres in the country" (<i>Works</i>, Ford edition, II, 7 ff.).</p>
<p>Eleven years later at the Philadelphia convention, Mason used the same
language as in the Virginia bill of rights, in opposing a real-estate qualification
for the national franchise; but he still advocated a landed qualification for
membership in even the lower House of Congress.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_132" id="Footnote_132"></a><a href="#FNanchor_132"><span class="label">[132]</span></a> Jefferson's plan was indorsed. " ... It is proposed that this bill, after
correction by the Convention, shall be referred by them to the people, to be
assembled in their respective counties; and that the suffrages of two-thirds
the counties shall be necessary to establish it." Jefferson always contended
that the Virginia constitution, since it was not so submitted to popular
ratification, was not a "fundamental law," but was subject to repeal, like
any other statute, by ordinary legislative action. Cf. <i>American History and
Government</i>, &sect; 152.</p></div>

Confederation</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>John Adams (<i>Works</i>, II, 492-502) preserved fairly full notes upon
part of the discussion on the Articles. The parts dealing with western
lands, with basis of taxation, and with the equality of the States in
Congress are reproduced here. The form is rather fragmentary; and, in
some cases, allusions are made which it would take too long to explain
here. But the student can at least get the general drift and the alignment
of the States on the opposing sides.</p></div>

<p class="center"><i>In Committee of the Whole</i></p>

<p>1776. July 25. Article 14 of the confederation. Terms in
this Article equivocal and indefinite.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p><i>Jefferson.</i> The limits of the Southern Colonies are fixed.
Moves an amendment, that all purchases of lands, not within
the boundaries of any Colony, shall be made by Congress of
the Indians in a great Council.</p>

<p><i>Sherman</i> seconds the motion.</p>

<p><i>Chase</i> [Maryland]. The intention of this Article is very
obvious and plain. The Article appears to me to be right and
the amendment wrong. It is the intention of some gentlemen
to limit the boundaries of particular States. No Colony has a
right to go to the South Sea; they never had; they can't have.
It would not be safe to the rest. It would be destructive to
her sisters and to herself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Article 15.</span> <i>Jefferson.</i> What are reasonable limits?
What security have we, that the Congress will not curtail the
present settlements of the States? I have no doubt that the
Colonies will limit themselves.</p>

<p><i>Wilson.</i> Every gentleman has heard much of claims to the
South Sea. They are extravagant. The grants were made
upon mistakes. They were ignorant of the Geography. They
thought the South Sea within one hundred miles of the
Atlantic Ocean. It was not conceived that they extended
three thousand miles. Lord Camden considers the claims to
the South Sea, as what never can be reduced to practice.
Pennsylvania has no right to interfere in those claims, but
she has a right to say, that she will not confederate unless
those claims are cut off. I wish the Colonies themselves would
cut off those claims....</p>

<p>July 30. Article 17. "In determining questions, each
Colony shall have one vote."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Franklin.</i> Let the smaller Colonies give equal money
and men, and then have an equal vote. But if they have an
equal vote without bearing equal burthens, a confederation
upon such iniquitous principles will never last long.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Witherspoon.</i> [New Jersey]. We all agree that there
must and shall be a confederation for this war. ... The
greatest danger we have, is of disunion among ourselves. Is
it not plausible that the small States will be oppressed by the
great ones? The Spartans and the Helots. The Romans
and their dependents. Every Colony is a distinct person....</p>

<p><i>Clark.</i> We must apply for pardons if we don't confederate.</p>

<p><i>Wilson.</i> We should settle upon some plan of representation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Wilson.</i> If the war continues two years, each soul will
have forty dollars to pay of the public debt. It will be the
greatest encouragement to continue slave-keeping and to increase
it, that can be, to exempt them from the numbers which
are to vote and pay. Slaves are taxables in the Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
Colonies. It will be partial and unequal. Some Colonies
have as many black as white; these will not pay more than
half what they ought.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Slaves prevent freemen from cultivating
a country. It is attended with many inconveniences.</p>

<p><i>Lynch</i> [South Carolina]. If it is debated, whether their
slaves are their property, there is an end of the confederation.
Our slaves being our property, why should they be taxed more
than the land, sheep, cattle, horses, etc.?</p>

<p>Freemen cannot be got to work in our Colonies; it is not in
the ability or inclination of freemen to do the work that the
negroes do. Carolina has taxed their negroes; so have other
Colonies their lands.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Franklin.</i> Slaves rather weaken than strengthen the
State, and there is therefore some difference between them
and sheep; sheep will never make any insurrections.</p>

<p><i>Rutledge.</i> I shall be happy to get rid of the idea of slavery.
The slaves do not signify property; the old and young cannot
work. The property of some Colonies is to be taxed, in others,
not. The Eastern Colonies will become the carriers for the
Southern; they will obtain wealth for which they will not be
taxed.</p>

<p>August 1. <i>Hooper.</i> North Carolina is a striking exception
to the general rule that was laid down yesterday, that the
riches of a country are in proportion to the numbers of inhabitants.
A gentleman of three or four hundred negroes
don't raise more corn than feeds them. A laborer can't be
hired for less than twenty-four pounds a year in Massachusetts
Bay. The net profit of a negro is not more than five or six
pounds per annum. I wish to see the day that slaves are not
necessary. Whites and negroes cannot work together.
Negroes are goods and chattels are property. A negro works
under the impulse of fear, has no care of his master's interest.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Consideration of the Seventeenth Article resumed</i></p>

<p>Article 17. <i>Dr. Franklin</i> moves that votes should be in
proportion to numbers. Mr. <i>Middleton</i> moves that the vote
should be according to what they pay.</p>

<p><i>Sherman</i> thinks we ought not to vote according to numbers.
We are representatives of States, not individuals. States of
Holland. The consent of every one is necessary. Three
Colonies would govern the whole, but would not have a
majority of strength to carry those votes into execution.
<b>The vote should be taken two ways; call the Colonies, and call
the individuals, and have a majority of both</b>.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p><i>Dr. Rush.</i> Abb&eacute; Raynal has attributed the ruin of the
United Provinces [Netherlands] to three causes. The principal
one is, that the consent of every State is necessary; the other,
that the members are obliged to consult their constituents
upon all occasions. We lose an equal representation; we
represent the people. It will tend to keep up colonial distinctions.
We are now a new nation. ... If we vote by
numbers, liberty will be always safe. Massachusetts is contiguous
to two small Colonies, Rhode Island and New
Hampshire; Pennsylvania is near New Jersey and Delaware;
Virginia is between Maryland and North Carolina. ...
Montesquieu pronounces the confederation of Lycia the best
that ever was made; the cities had different weights in the
scale. ... I would not have it understood that I am pleading
the cause of Pennsylvania; when I entered that door, I considered
myself a citizen of America.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p><i>G. Hopkins</i> [Rhode Island]. A momentous question; many
difficulties on each side; four larger, five lesser, four stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>indifferent. Virginia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maryland,
make more than half the people.</p>

<p>... It can't be expected that nine Colonies will give way
to be governed by four. The safety of the whole depends upon
the distinctions of Colonies.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Franklin.</i> I hear many ingenious arguments to persuade
us that an unequal representation is a very good thing. If we
had been born and bred under an unequal representation, we
might bear it; but to set out with an unequal representation
is unreasonable. It is said the great Colonies will swallow up
the less. Scotland said the same thing at the union.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>August 2. "Limiting the bounds of States, which by charter,
&amp;c. extend to the South Sea."</p>

<p><i>Sherman</i> thinks the bounds ought to be settled. A majority
of States have no claim to the South Sea. Moves this amendment
to be substituted in place of this clause, and also instead
of the fifteenth article;&mdash;"No lands to be separated from any
State, which are already settled, or become private property."</p>

<p><i>Chase</i> [Maryland] denies that any Colony has a right to go
to the South Sea.</p>

<p><i>Harrison</i> [Virginia]. How came Maryland by its land, but
by its charter? By its charter, Virginia owns to the South
Sea. Gentlemen shall not pare away the Colony of Virginia.
Rhode Island has more generosity than to wish the Massachusetts
pared away. Delaware does not wish to pare away
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><i>Huntington.</i> Admit there is danger from Virginia, does it
follow that Congress has a right to limit her bounds? The
consequence is, not to enter into confederation....</p>

<p><i>Stone</i> [Maryland] ... Is it meant that Virginia shall sell
these lands for their own emolument? All the Colonies have
defended these lands against the King of Britain, and at the
expense of all. Does Virginia intend to establish quit
rents?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jefferson.</i> I protest against the right of Congress to decide
upon the right of Virginia. Virginia has released all claims
to the land settled by Maryland, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This clause, as to limiting the western claims, was stricken out in
committee. The subsequent history of the struggle is well known, terminating
in the acts of cession of claims to the western territory. For
details, cf. <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect;&sect; 179-180.</p>

<p>Jefferson's Notes on this same debate (<i>Journals of Congress</i>, VI, 1104,&mdash;from
a MS. of Jefferson's) contain the following additional item:
"<i>John Adams</i> advocated voting in proportion to numbers. He said that
we stand here as representatives of the people; that in some States the
people are many, in others they are few ... that the individuality of
the colonies is a mere sound. ... <b><i>It has been said we are independent
individuals making a bargain together: the question is not what we are now,
but what we ought to be when our bargain shall be made.</i></b> The Confederacy
<span class="smcap">IS TO MAKE US ONE</span> individual only; it is to form us, like separate parcels
of metal, into one common mass. ..."<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>]</p></div>

<h4>148. Desire for Statehood; Self-confidence of the West</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Early in 1784, North Carolina ceded her western territory (afterward
Tennessee) to Congress, giving that body two years in which to accept.
The Westerners, already bitterly dissatisfied, now complained loudly that
the mother State had cast them off; they would not wait two years,
in anarchy, for possible action by the dilatory Congress; they would
take their fate at once into their own hands. Accordingly, the three
counties of eastern Tennessee (the outgrowth of the Watauga settlement,
numbering now some 10,000 souls) established themselves for a time as
the State of Frankland ("Land of the Freemen").</p>

<p>The militia had been organized by territorial units, each "company"
from one group of hamlets, or "stations." Each "company" now chose
delegates to a central convention. This "preliminary" convention recommended
the people to choose another "constitutional convention,"<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
with full powers to set up a government. August 23, 1784, this second
convention, composed of forty delegates with John Sevier as president,
resolved on immediate statehood, and put forth an interesting address
to justify that action. The following passage from that address illustrates
the wild hopes of the West as to immediate development. (Cf. also
<i>American History and Government</i>, &sect;&sect; 173-175.)</p></div>

<p>"If we should be so happy as to have a separate government,
vast numbers from different quarters, with a little encouragement
from the public, would fill up our frontier; which would
strengthen us, improve agriculture, perfect manufactures, encourage
literature and everything truly laudable. The seat
of government being among ourselves would evidently tend,
not only to keep a circulating medium in gold and silver
among us,<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> but would draw it from many individuals living in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>other States, who claim large quantities of land that would
lie within the bounds of the new State."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[A constitution was adopted by yet a third convention, and government
instituted under it. North Carolina, however, repealed her cession before
Congress had accepted it, and reasserted her authority over "Frankland,"
not without long and bitter conflict.]</p></div>

Territory. April 23, 1784</i></h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Journals of Congress</i> (1801 edition), IX, 109-110.</p>

<p>This act is usually known as Jefferson's Territorial Ordinance of 1784.
For history, cf. <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 181. It is given
here mainly for comparison with the Ordinance of 1787 (No. 149<i>b</i>), and,
<i>by most students, it can be read to best advantage after a study of that
document</i>.</p></div>

<p>"Resolved that so much of the territory ceded or to be ceded by individual
states to the United States [the rest of this paragraph provides
for division into two tiers of states, bounded by alternate parallels of
latitude, with some rather obscure provisions for fragmentary pieces of
territory on the north and east, cf. <i>American History and Government</i>,
&sect; 181.]</p>

<p>"That the settlers on any territory so purchased, and offered for sale,
shall, either on their own petition or order of Congress, receive authority
from them, with appointments of time and place, for their free males of
full age within the limits of their state to meet together, for the purpose
of establishing a temporary government, to adopt the constitution and
laws of any one of the original states; so that such laws nevertheless
shall be subject to alteration by their ordinary legislature; and to erect,
subject to a like alteration, counties, townships, or other divisions, for
the election of members for their legislature.</p>

<p>"That when any such state shall have acquired 20,000 free inhabitants,
on giving due proof thereof to Congress, they shall receive from them
authority, with appointments of time and place, to call a convention of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>representatives to establish a permanent constitution and government for
themselves. Provided that both the temporary and permanent governments
be established on these principles as their basis:</p>

<p>"1st. That they shall for ever remain a part of this confederacy of the
United States of America.</p>

<p>"2d. That they shall be subject to the articles of confederation in all
those cases in which the original states shall be so subject, and to all the
acts and ordinances of the United States in Congress assembled, conformable
thereto.</p>

<p>"3d. That they in no case shall interfere with the primary disposal
of the soil by the United States in Congress assembled, nor with the
ordinances and regulations which Congress may find necessary, for securing
the title in such soil to the <i>bona fide</i> purchasers.</p>

<p>"4th. That they shall be subject to pay a part of the federal debts
contracted or to be contracted, to be apportioned on them by Congress,
according to the same common rule and measure by which apportionments
thereof shall be made on the other states.</p>

<p>"5th. That no tax shall be imposed on lands, the property of the
United States.</p>

<p>"6th. That their respective governments shall be republican.</p>

<p>"7th. That the lands of non-resident proprietors shall, in no case, be
taxed higher than those of residents within any new state, before the
admission thereof to a vote by its delegates in Congress.</p>

<p>"That whensoever any of the said states shall have, of free inhabitants,
as many as shall then be in any one the least numerous of the thirteen
original states, such state shall be admitted by its delegates into the
Congress of the United States, on an equal footing with the said original
states; provided the consent of so many states in Congress is first obtained
as may at the time be competent to such admission. (And in
order to adapt the said articles of confederation to the state of Congress
when its numbers shall be thus increased, it shall be proposed to the
legislatures of the states, originally parties thereto, to require the assent
of two-thirds of the United States in Congress assembled, in all those
cases wherein by the said articles, the assent of nine states is now required,
which being agreed to by them, shall be binding on the new
states.) Until such admission by their delegates into Congress, any of
the said states after the establishment of their temporary government
shall have authority to keep a member in Congress, with a right of
debating, but not of voting.</p>

<p>"That measures not inconsistent with the principles of the confederation,
and necessary for the preservation of peace and good order among
the settlers in any of the said new States, until they shall assume a tem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>porary
government as aforesaid, may from time to time, be taken by the
United States in Congress assembled.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>"That the preceding articles shall be formed into a charter of compact
... [provision for promulgation] and shall stand as fundamental constitutions
between the thirteen original States and each of the several States
now newly described, unalterable ... but by the joint consent of the
United States in Congress assembled and of the particular State within
which such alteration is proposed to be made."</p>

<p><i>An Ordinance for the government of the territory of the United
States Northwest of the River Ohio</i></p>

<p>Be it ordained by the United States in Congress Assembled
that the said territory for the purposes of temporary government
be one district, subject however to be divided into two
districts as future circumstances may in the opinion of Congress
make it expedient.</p>

<p>Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid, that the estates
both of resident and non resident proprietors in the said territory
dying intestate shall descend to and be distributed among
their children and the descendants of a deceased child in equal
parts; the descendants of a deceased child or grandchild to take
the share of their deceased parent in equal parts among them;
and where there shall be no children or descendants then in equal
parts to the next of kin in equal degree; and among collaterals
the children of a deceased brother or sister of the intestate shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>have in equal parts among them their deceased parent's share
and there shall in no case be a distinction between kindred of
the whole and half blood; saving in all cases to the widow of
the intestate her third part of the real estate for life, and one
third part of the personal estate: and this law relative to descents
and dower shall remain in full force until altered by the
legislature of the district. And until the governor and judges
shall adopt laws as herein after mentioned, estates in the said
territory may be devised or bequeathed by wills in writing
signed and sealed by him or her in whom the estate may be, being
of full age, and attested by three witnesses, and real estates
may be conveyed by lease and release or bargain and sale, signed,
sealed and delivered by the person being of full age in whom
the estate may be, and attested by two witnesses, provided such
wills be duly proved and such conveyances be acknowledged
or the execution there of duly proved, and be recorded within
one year after proper magistrates, courts and registers shall be
appointed for that purpose; and personal property may be transferred
by delivery saving however to the French and Canadian
inhabitants and other settlers of the Kaskaskies, Saint Vincents
and the neighbouring villages, who have hereto fore professed
themselves citizens of Virginia, their laws and customs now in
force among them, relative to the descent and conveyance of
property.</p>

<p>Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid, that there shall be
appointed, from time to time, by Congress, a governor, whose
commission shall continue in force for the term of three years,
unless sooner revoked by Congress; he shall reside in the district,
and have a freehold estate therein in 1000 acres of land,
while in the exercise of his office.</p>

<p>There shall be appointed, from time to time, by Congress,
a secretary, whose commission shall continue in force for four
years unless sooner revoked; he shall reside in the district,
and have a freehold estate therein in 500 acres of land, while in
the exercise of his office; it shall be his duty to keep and preserve
the acts and laws passed by the legislature, and the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
records of the district, and the proceedings of the governor in
his Executive department; and transmit authentic copies of
such acts and proceedings, every six months, to the Secretary
of Congress: There shall also be appointed a court to consist of
three judges, any two of whom to form a court, who shall have
a common law jurisdiction, and reside in the district, and have
each therein a freehold estate in 500 acres of land while in the
exercise of their offices; and their commissions shall continue
in force during good behavior.</p>

<p>The governor and judges, or a majority of them, shall adopt
and publish in the district such laws of the original States,
criminal and civil, as may be necessary and best suited to the
circumstances of the district, and report them to Congress
from time to time: which laws shall be in force in the district
until the organization of the General Assembly therein, unless
disapproved of by Congress; but, afterwards, the legislature
shall have authority to alter them as they shall think fit.</p>

<p>The governor, for the time being, shall be commander-in-chief
of the militia, appoint and commission all officers in the
same below the rank of general officers; all general officers
shall be appointed and commissioned by Congress.</p>

<p>Previous to the organization of the General Assembly, the
governor shall appoint such magistrates and other civil officers,
in each county or township, as he shall find necessary for the
preservation of the peace and good order in the same. After
the General Assembly shall be organized, the powers and
duties of the magistrates and other civil officers shall be
regulated and defined by the said Assembly; but all ... civil
officers not herein otherwise directed shall during the continuance
of this temporary government be appointed by the
governor.</p>

<p>For the prevention of crimes and injuries the laws to be
adopted or made shall have force in all parts of the district;
and for the execution of process criminal and civil, the governor
shall make proper divisions thereof, and he shall proceed
from time to time as circumstances may require to lay out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
parts of the District in which the Indian titles shall have been
extinguished into counties and townships subject however to
such alterations as may thereafter be made by the legislature.</p>

<p>So soon as there shall be five thousand free male inhabitants
of full age in the district, upon giving proof thereof to the
governor, they shall receive authority with time and place to
elect representatives from their counties or townships to represent
them in the general Assembly, provided that for every five
hundred free male inhabitants there shall be one representative;
and so on progressively with the number of free male
inhabitants shall the right of representation encrease until the
number of representatives shall amount to twenty five, after
which the number and proportion of representatives shall be
regulated by the legislature; provided that no person be eligible
or qualified to act as a representative unless he shall have
been a citizen of one of the United States three years and be
a resident in the district or unless he shall have resided in the
district three years, and in either case shall likewise hold in
his own right in fee simple two hundred acres of land within
the same; provided also that a freehold in fifty acres of land
in the district having been a citizen of one of the states and
being resident in the district, or the like freehold and two
years residence in the district shall be necessary to qualify a
man as an elector of a representative.</p>

<p>The representatives thus elected shall serve for the term of
two years, and in case of the death of a representative or
removal from office, the governor shall issue a writ to the
county or township for which he was a member, to elect
another in his stead to serve for the residue of the term.</p>

<p>The general Assembly or legislature shall consist of the
governor, legislative council and a house of representatives.
The legislative council shall consist of five members to continue
in Office five years unless sooner removed by Congress,
any three of whom to be a quorum and the members of the
council shall be nominated and appointed in the following
manner, to wit: As soon as representatives shall be elected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
the governor shall appoint a time and place for them to meet
together; and, when met, they shall nominate ten persons,
residents in the district, and each possessed of a freehold in
500 acres of land, and return their names to Congress; five of
whom Congress shall appoint and commission to serve as
aforesaid; and, whenever a vacancy shall happen in the
council, by death or removal from office, the house of representatives
shall nominate two persons, qualified as aforesaid,
for each vacancy, and return their names to Congress; one of
whom Congress shall appoint and commission for the residue
of the term. And every five years, four months at least before
the expiration of the time of service of the members of
council, the said house shall nominate ten persons, qualified as
aforesaid, and return their names to Congress; five of whom
Congress shall appoint and commission to serve as members of
the council five years, unless sooner removed. And the
governor, legislative council, and house of representatives,
shall have authority to make laws in all cases, for the good
government of the district, not repugnant to the principles
and articles in this ordinance established and declared. And
all bills, having passed by a majority in the house, and by a
majority in the council, shall be referred to the governor for
his assent; but no bill, or legislative act whatever, shall be of
any force without his assent. The governor shall have power
to convene, prorogue, and dissolve the General Assembly,
when, in his opinion, it shall be expedient.</p>

<p>The governor, judges, legislative council, secretary, and
such other officers as Congress shall appoint in the district,
shall take an oath or affirmation of fidelity and of office; the
governor before the President of Congress, and all other officers
before the governor. As soon as a legislature shall be formed
in the district, the council and house assembled in one room,
shall have authority, by joint ballot, to elect a delegate to
Congress, who shall have a seat in Congress, with a right of
debating but not of voting during this temporary government.</p>

<p><i>And, for extending the fundamental principles of civil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>

Persons shall be bailable unless for capital offences, where
the proof shall be evident, or the presumption great; all fines
shall be moderate, and no cruel or unusual punishments shall
be inflicted; no man shall be deprived of his liberty or property
but by the judgment of his Peers, or the law of the land;
and should the Public exigencies make it necessary for the
common preservation to take any person's property, or to
demand his particular Services, full compensation shall be

property it is understood and declared, that no law ought ever
to be made, or have force in the said territory, that shall in
any manner whatever interfere with or affect private Contracts
or engagements, bona fide and without fraud previously formed.</p>

<p>Article the Third. Religion, Morality and knowledge being
necessary to good Government and the happiness of mankind,
Schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.
The utmost good faith shall always be observed towards
the Indians; their lands and property shall never be taken
from them without their consent; and in their property, rights
and liberty, they never shall be invaded or disturbed, unless
in just and lawful wars authorized by Congress; but laws
founded in justice and humanity shall from time to time be
made, for preventing wrongs being done to them, and for
preserving peace and friendship with them&mdash;</p>

<p>Article the Fourth. The said Territory, and the States
which may be formed therein, shall forever remain a part of
this Confederacy ... subject to the Articles of Confederation,
and to such alterations therein as shall be constitutionally
made; and to all the acts and ordinances of the United States
in Congress assembled, conformable thereto. The inhabitants
and settlers in the said territory shall be subject to pay a
part of the federal debts contracted or to be contracted, and
a proportional part of the expenses of government, to be apportioned
on them by Congress according to the same common
rule and measure by which apportionments thereof shall be
made on the other States; and the taxes, for paying their
proportion, shall be laid and levied by the authority and direction
of the legislatures of the district or districts, or new States,
as in the original States within the time agreed upon by the
United States in Congress assembled. The legislatures of
those districts or new States shall never interfere with the primary
disposal of the soil by the United States in Congress assembled,
nor with any regulations Congress may find necessary
for securing the title in such soil to the <i>bona fide</i> purchasers.
No tax shall be imposed on lands the property of the United
States; and, in no case, shall non-resident proprietors be taxed
higher than residents. The navigable waters leading into the
Mississippi and St. Lawrence, and the carrying places between
the same, shall be common highways, and forever free, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
to the inhabitants of the said territory as to the citizens of the
United States, and those of any other States that may be admitted
into the Confederacy, without any tax, impost, or duty,
therefor.</p>

<p>Article the Fifth. There shall be formed in the said territory,
not less than three nor more than five States; and the boundaries
of the States, as soon as Virginia shall alter her act of
cession, and consent to the same, shall become fixed and established
as follows, to wit: The Western State in the said
territory, shall be bounded by the Mississippi, the Ohio, and
Wabash rivers; a direct line drawn from the Wabash and Post
St. Vincent's, due North, to the territorial line between the
United States and Canada; and, by the said territorial line,
to the Lake of the Woods and Mississippi. The middle State
shall be bounded by the said direct line, the Wabash from Post
Vincent's, to the Ohio; by the Ohio, by a direct line, drawn
due North from the mouth of the Great Miami, to the said
territorial line, and by the said territorial line. The Eastern
State shall be bounded by the last mentioned direct line, the
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the said territorial line: <i>Provided
however</i>, and it is further understood and declared, that the
boundaries of these three States shall be subject so far to be
altered, that, if Congress shall hereafter find it expedient,
they shall have authority to form one or two States in that
part of the said territory which lies North of an East and West
line drawn through the Southerly bend or extreme of lake
Michigan. And, whenever any of the said States shall have
60,000 free inhabitants therein, such State shall be admitted,
by its delegates, into the Congress of the United States, on an
equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever,
and shall be at liberty to form a permanent constitution and
State government: <i>Provided</i>, the constitution and government,
so to be formed, shall be republican, and in conformity to the
principles contained in these articles; and, so far as it can be
consistent with the general interest of the confederacy, such
admission shall be allowed at an earlier period, and when there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
may be a less number of free inhabitants in the State than
60,000.</p>

<p><i>Article the Sixth. There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary
servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the punishment
of crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted:
Provided, always, That any person escaping into the same, from
whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the original
States, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and conveyed
to the person claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid.</i></p>

<p><i>Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid</i>, That the resolutions
of the 23d of April, 1784, relative to the subject of this ordinance,
be, and the same are hereby, repealed and declared null
and void.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>[The great Sixth Article has rendered this Ordinance immortal. This
anti-slavery provision, however, has been spoken of sometimes in terms
more rhetorical than exact. Senator Hoar, in a centennial memorial
oration at Marietta, in 1888, said: "Here was the first human government
under which absolute civil and religious liberty has always prevailed.
... Here no slave was ever born, or dwelt." The student may
compare <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 333, close. But Daniel
Webster was the historian rather than merely the orator when he said:
"I doubt whether one single law of any lawgiver, ancient or modern, has
produced effects of more distinct, marked, and lasting character, than the
Ordinance of 1787."</p>

<p>August 7, 1789, the First Congress under the Constitution passed a
<i>Confirmatory Act</i>, reenacting the Northwest Ordinance, with the provision
that the appointments therein referred to Congress should be made
by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate.]</p></div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mount Vernon</span>, October 31, 1786.</p>

<p>... The picture which you have exhibited ... of the commotions
and temper of numerous bodies in the eastern States, are
equally to be lamented and deprecated. They exhibit a melancholy
proof of what our transatlantic foe has predicted; and of
another thing perhaps, which is still more to be regretted, and is
yet more unaccountable, <b>that mankind, when left to themselves, are
unfit for their own government</b>. I am mortified beyond expression
when I view the clouds that have spread over the brightest
morn that ever dawned upon any country. In a word, I am
lost in amazement when I behold what intrigue, the interested
views of desperate characters, ignorance, and jealously of the
minor part, are capable of effecting, as a scourge on the major
part of our fellow citizens of the Union; for it is hardly to be
supposed, that the great body of the people, though they will
not act, can be so shortsighted or enveloped in darkness, as
not to see rays of a distant sun through all this mist of intoxication
and folly.</p>

<p>You talk, my good Sir, of employing influence to appease the
present tumults in Massachusetts. I know not where that influence
is to be found, or, if attainable, that it would be a proper
remedy for the disorders. <i>Influence</i> is no <i>government</i>. Let us
have one by which our lives, liberties, and properties will be
secured, or let us know the worst at once. Under these impressions,
my humble opinion is, that there is a call for decision.
Know precisely what the insurgents aim at. If they
have <i>real</i> grievances, redress them if possible; or acknowledge
the justice of them, and your inability to do it in the present
moment. If they have not, employ the force of government
against them at once. If this is inadequate, <i>all</i> will be con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>vinced,
that the superstructure is bad, or wants support. To
be more exposed in the eyes of the world, and more contemptible
than we already are, is hardly possible. To delay one or the
other of these, is to exasperate ... or to give confidence, and
will add to their numbers; for, like snow-balls, such bodies
increase by every moment unless there is something in the
way to obstruct and crumble them before the weight is too
great and irresistible....</p>

<p>(2) <i>George Washington, to James Madison.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Writings</i> (Ford edition), XI, 80, 81. Note especially the extracts
quoted from General Lincoln, in command against the rebels.</p></div>

<p class="right">November 5, 1786.</p>

<p>I thank you for the communications in your letter of the 1st
instant. ... Fain would I hope that the great and most important
of all subjects, the <i>federal government</i>, may be considered
with ... calm and deliberate attention. ... No morn ever
dawned more favorably than ours did; and no day was ever
more clouded than the present. Wisdom and good examples
are necessary at this time to rescue the political machine from
the impending storm. Virginia has now an opportunity to set
the latter, and has enough of the former, I hope, to take the
lead in promoting this great and arduous work. Without an
alteration in our political creed, the superstructure we have
been seven years in raising, at the expense of so much treasure
and blood, must fall. We are fast verging to anarchy
and confusion.</p>

<p>... a letter which I have received from General Knox, who
had just returned from Massachusetts, whither he had been
sent by Congress consequent of the commotions in that State,
is replete with melancholy accounts of the temper and designs
of a considerable part of that people. Among other things he
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Their creed is, that the property of the United States has been protected
from the confiscation of Britain by the joint exertions of <i>all</i>; and therefore
ought to be the <i>common property of all</i>; and he that attempts opposi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>tion
to this creed, is an enemy to equity and justice, and ought to be swept
from off the face of the earth." Again: "They are determined to annihilate
all debts, public and private, and have agrarian laws, which are
easily effected by the means of unfunded paper money, which shall be a
tender in all cases whatever." He adds: "The number of these people
amount in Massachusetts to about one fifth part of several populous counties,
and to them may be collected people of similar sentiments from the
States of Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, so as to constitute
a body of about twelve or fifteen thousand desperate and unprincipled
men. They are chiefly of the young and active part of the community."</p></div>

<p>How melancholy is the reflection, that in so short a space we
should have made such large strides towards fulfilling the predictions
of our transatlantic foes! "Leave them to themselves,
and their government will soon dissolve." Will not the
wise and good strive hard to avert this evil? Or will their supineness
suffer ignorance, and the arts of self interested, designing,
disaffected, and desperate characters, to involve this great
country in wretchedness and contempt? What stronger evidence
can be given of the want of energy in our government,
than these disorders? If there is not power in it to check them,
what security has a man for life, liberty, or property? To you
I am sure I need not add aught on this subject. The consequences
of a lax or inefficient government are too obvious to be
dwelt upon. Thirteen sovereignties pulling against each other,
and all tugging at the federal head, will soon bring ruin on
the whole; whereas a liberal and energetic constitution, well
guarded and closely watched to prevent encroachments, might
restore us to that degree of respectability and consequence to
which we had a fair claim....</p>

the Adoption of a New Constitution</h4>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, October 10, 1786.</p>

<p>[The letter first describes the failure of the Annapolis
Convention.]</p>

<p>The people are not ignorant that the natural consequences
of an increase of power in the government would be a regular
collection of taxes, a strict administration of justice, extraordinary
duties on imports, <b><i>rigorous executions against debtors</i></b>&mdash;in
short, <b><i>a marked preponderance of rich men and of large proprietors</i></b>.</p>

<p>It is, however, for the interest of the people to guard as
much as possible the absolute freedom granted them in a time
when no other law was known but necessity, and when an
English army, as it were, laid the foundations of the political
constitution.</p>

<p>In those stormy times <b><i>it was necessary</i></b> to agree that all power
ought to emanate only from the people; that everything was
subject to its supreme will, and that the magistrates were
only its servants.</p>

<p>Although there are no nobles in America, there is a class
of men denominated "gentlemen," who, by reason of their
wealth, their talents, their education, their families, or the
offices they hold, <b><i>aspire to a pre-eminence which the people refuse to
grant them</i></b>; and, although many of these men have betrayed
the interests of their order to gain popularity, <b><i>there reigns
among them a connection so much the more intimate as they almost
all of them dread the efforts of the people to despoil them of their
possessions, and, moreover, they are creditors</i></b>, and therefore interested
in strengthening the government, and watching over
the execution of the laws....</p>

<p>The majority of them being merchants, it is for their interest
to establish the credit of the United States in Europe
on a solid foundation by the exact payment of debts, and to
grant to congress powers extensive enough to compel the
people to contribute for this purpose. The attempt, my lord,
has been vain, by pamphlets and other publications, to spread
notions of justice and integrity, and to deprive the people of
a freedom which they have so misused. By proposing a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
organization of the federal government all minds would have
been revolted; circumstances ruinous to the commerce of
America have happily arisen to furnish the reformers with a
pretext for introducing innovations.</p>

<p>They represented to the people that the American name
had become opprobrious among all the nations of Europe; that
the flag of the United States was everywhere exposed to
insults and annoyance....</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Otto continues at length to represent that the gentry sought to secure
a stronger government by inflaming the common people against foreign
powers. He then declares that it was never intended that the Annapolis
convention should do anything; that it was only one step in a "plot"
to secure a more unfettered convention.]</p></div>

<p>The measures were so well taken that at the end of September
no more than five states were represented at Annapolis, and
the commissioners from the northern states tarried several
days at New York, in order to retard their arrival.</p>

<p>The states which assembled, after having waited nearly three
weeks, separated under the pretext that they were not in sufficient
numbers to enter on business, and, to justify this dissolution,
they addressed to the different legislatures and to congress
a report, the translation of which I have the honor to enclose
to you [i.e., the paper reproduced in No. 153].</p>

<p>In this paper the commissioners employ an infinity of circumlocutions
and ambiguous phrases to show to their constituents
the impossibility of taking into consideration a general
plan of commerce and the powers pertaining thereto, without
at the same time touching upon other objects closely connected
with the prosperity and national importance of the United
States.</p>

<p>Without enumerating these objects, the commissioners enlarge
upon the present crisis of public affairs, upon the dangers
to which the confederation is exposed, upon the want of credit
of the United States abroad, and upon the necessity of uniting,
under a single point of view, the interests of all the states.</p>

<p>They close by proposing, for the month of May next, a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
assembly of commissioners, instructed to deliberate not only
upon a general plan of commerce, but upon other matters which
may concern the harmony and welfare of the states, and upon
the means of rendering the federal government adequate to the
exigencies of the union.</p>

<p>In spite of the obscurity of this document, you will perceive,
my lord, that the commissioners were unwilling to take into
consideration the grievances of commerce, which are of exceeding
interest for the people, without at the same time perfecting
the fundamental constitution of congress.</p>

<p>To the Honorable the Legislatures of Virginia, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.</p>

<p>The Commissioners from the said States respectively Assembled
at the City of Annapolis, humbly beg leave to Report:</p>

<p>That, pursuant to their several Appointments, they met at
Annapolis in the State of Maryland, on the eleventh day of
September Instant, and, having proceeded to a communication
of their Powers, they found that the States of New York,
Pennsylvania and Virginia had, in substance, and nearly in
the same terms, authorized their respective Commissioners "to
meet such Commissioners as were or might be appointed by the
other States in the Union, at such time and Place as should be
agreed upon by the said Commissioners, to take into Consideration
the trade and Commerce of the United States, to consider
how far an uniform System in their commercial intercourse
and regulations might be necessary to their common interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
and permanent harmony, and <i>to report, to the several States</i>,
such an Act relative to this great Object, <i>as when unanimously
ratified by them</i>, would enable the United States in Congress
Assembled effectually to provide for the same."</p>

<p>That the State of Delaware had given similar Powers to their
Commissioners, with this difference only, that the Act to be
framed in virtue of those Powers, is required to be reported
"to the United States in Congress Assembled to be agreed to
by them and Confirmed by the Legislatures of every State."</p>

<p>That the State of New Jersey has enlarged the Object of their
Appointment, empowering their Commissioners, "to consider
how far an uniform System in their Commercial Regulations,
and <i>other important matters</i>, might be necessary to the common
interest and permanent harmony of the several States;" and
to "report such an Act on the Subject, as when ratified by
them" would "enable the United States in Congress Assembled
effectually to provide <i>for the exigencies of the Union</i>."</p>

<p>That appointments of Commissioners have also been made
by the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island and North Carolina, none of whom have however
attended, but that no information has been received by your
Commissioners of any Appointment having been made by the
States of Connecticut, Maryland, South-Carolina or Georgia.</p>

<p>That the express terms of the Powers to your Commissioners
supposing a Deputation from <i>all</i> the States, and having
for Object <i>the trade and Commerce of the United States</i>,
your Commissioners did not conceive it advisable to proceed
on the business of their Mission, under the Circumstance of
so partial and defective a Representation.</p>

<p>Deeply impressed however with the magnitude and importance
of the Object confided to them on this Occasion, your
Commissioners cannot forbear to indulge an expression of
their earnest and unanimous wish that speedy measures may
be taken to effect a general meeting of the States in a future
Convention, for the same, and such other Purposes, as the
situation of Public Affairs may be found to require.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span></p>

<p>If in expressing this wish, or in intimating any other
Sentiment, your Commissioners should seem to exceed the
strict bounds of their Appointment, they entertain a full
Confidence that a Conduct dictated by an anxiety for the
welfare of the United States, will not fail to receive an
indulgent Construction.</p>

<p>In this persuasion, your Commissioners submit an Opinion,
that the Idea of extending the Powers of their Deputies to
other Objects than those of Commerce, which has been
adopted by the State of New Jersey, was an improvement on
the original Plan, and will deserve to be incorporated into that
of a future Convention. They are the more naturally led to
which Conclusion, as in the course of the Reflections on the
Subject, they have been induced to think, that the Power of
regulating Trade, is of such comprehensive extent, and will
enter so far into the General System of the F&oelig;deral Government,
that to give it efficacy, and to obviate questions and
doubts concerning its precise nature and limits, may require a
corresponding adjustment of other Parts of the F&oelig;deral
System.</p>

<p>That there are important defects in the System of the
F&oelig;deral Government, is acknowledged by the Acts of those
States which have concurred in the present Meeting. That
the defects, upon a closer examination may be found greater
and more numerous than even these Acts imply, is at least so
far probable from the embarrassments which characterize the
present state of our National Affairs, foreign and domestic, as
may reasonably be supposed to merit a deliberate and candid
discussion, in some mode, which will unite the Sentiments and
Councils of all the States. In the choice of the mode, your
Commissioners are of Opinion that a Convention of Deputies
from the different States, for the special and sole purpose of
entering into this investigation and digesting a Plan for supplying
such defects as may be discovered to exist, will be
entitled to a preference, from Considerations which will occur
without being particularized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span></p>

<p>Your Commissioners decline an enumeration of those
National Circumstances on which their Opinion respecting the
Propriety of a future Convention with more enlarged Powers
is founded; as it would be an useless intrusion of facts and
Observations, most of which have been frequently the Subject
of Public Discussion, and none of which can have escaped the
penetration of those to whom they would in this instance be
addressed. They are however of a nature so serious as, in the
View of your Commissioners, to render the situation of the
United States delicate and critical, calling for an exertion of
the united Virtue and Wisdom of all the Members of the
Confederacy.</p>

<p>Under this Impression Your Commissioners, with the most
respectful deference, beg leave to suggest <b><i>their unanimous conviction
that it may essentially tend to advance the interests of the
Union, if the States by whom they have been respectively delegated
would themselves concur, and use their endeavours to procure the concurrence
of the other States, in the Appointment of Commissioners
to meet at Philadelphia on the second Monday in May next, to take
into Consideration the situation of the United States, to devise such
further Provisions as shall appear to them necessary to render the
Constitution of the F&oelig;deral Government adequate to the exigencies of
the Union; and to report such an Act for that purpose to the United
States in Congress Assembled, as when "agreed to by them and
afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of every State" will effectually
provide for the same</i></b>.</p>

<p>Though your Commissioners could not with propriety address
these Observations and Sentiments to any but the States they
have the honor to Represent, they have nevertheless concluded,
from motives of respect, to transmit Copies of this Report, to
the United States in Congress Assembled, and to the Executives
of the other States.</p>

<h4>155. George Mason on the Preliminaries at Philadelphia</h4>

<p class="center"><i>George Mason to George Mason, Jr.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Records of the Federal Convention</i> (Farrand), III, 22-24.</p></div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, May 20th, 1787.</p>

<p>... Upon our arrival here on Thursday evening, seventeenth
May, I found only the States of Virginia and Pennsylvania
fully represented; and there are at this time only five&mdash;New
York, the two Carolinas, and the two before mentioned. All
the States, Rhode Island excepted, have made their appointments;
but the members drop in slowly; some of the deputies
from the Eastern States are here, but none of them have yet a
sufficient representation, and it will probably be several days
before the Convention will be authorized to proceed to business.
The expectations and hopes of all the Union centre in this
Convention. God grant that we may be able to concert effectual
means of preserving our country from the evils which
threaten us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span></p>

<p>The Virginia deputies (who are all here) meet and confer
together two or three hours every day, in order to form a
proper correspondence of sentiments; and for form's sake, to
see what new deputies are arrived, and to grow into some
acquaintance with each other, we regularly meet every day at
three o'clock. These and some occasional conversations with
the deputies of different States and with some of the general
officers of the late army (who are here upon a general meeting
of the Cincinnati), are the only opportunities I have
hitherto had of forming any opinion upon the great subject of
our mission, and, consequently, a very imperfect and indecisive
one. Yet, upon the great principles of it, I have reason to
hope there will be greater unanimity and less opposition,
except from the little States, than was at first apprehended.
The most prevalent idea in the principal States seems to be a
total alteration of the present federal system, and substituting
a great national council or parliament, consisting of two
branches of the legislature, founded upon the principles of
equal proportionate representation, with full legislative powers
upon all the subjects of the Union; and an executive: and to
make the several State legislatures subordinate to the national,
by giving the latter the power of a negative upon all such laws
as they shall judge contrary to the interest of the federal
Union ... and what is a very extraordinary phenomenon,
we are likely to find the republicans, on this occasion,
issue from the Southern and Middle States, and the anti-republicans
from the Eastern; however extraordinary this
may at first seem, it may, I think be accounted for from a
very common and natural impulse of the human mind. Men
disappointed in expectations too hastily and sanguinely formed,
tired and disgusted with the unexpected evils they have
experienced, and anxious to remove them as far as possible,
are very apt to run into the opposite extreme; and the people
of the Eastern States, setting out with more republican principles,
have consequently been more disappointed than we
have been....</p>

<h4>156. The Virginia Plan</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Records of the Federal Convention</i> (Farrand), I, 20-22, for May 29.
For history of the plan, cf. <i>American History and Government</i>, &sect; 202. On
the opening day of the Philadelphia Convention for business Mr. Randolph,
after a brilliant speech, introduced the following resolutions in behalf
of the Virginia delegation.</p></div>

<p>1. Resolved that the articles of Confederation ought to be so
corrected and enlarged as to accomplish the objects proposed by
their institution; namely, "common defence, security of liberty
and general welfare."</p>

<p>2. Resd. therefore that the rights of suffrage in the National
Legislature ought to be proportioned to the Quotas of contribution,
or to the number of free inhabitants, as the one or the
other rule may seem best in different cases.</p>

<p>3. Resd. that the National Legislature ought to consist of
two branches.</p>

<p>4. Resd. that the members of the first branch of the National
Legislature ought to be elected by the people of the several States
every &mdash;&mdash; for the term of &mdash;&mdash;; to be of the age of &mdash;&mdash; years
at least; to receive liberal stipends by which they may be compensated
for the devotion of their time to public service; to be
ineligible to any office established by a particular State, or under
the authority of the United States, except those peculiarly
belonging to the functions of the first branch, during the term
of service, and for the space of &mdash;&mdash; after its expiration; to be
incapable of re-election for the space of &mdash;&mdash; after the expiration
of their term of service, and to be subject to recall.</p>

<p>5. Resd. that the members of the second branch of the
National Legislature ought to be elected by those of the
first, out of a proper number of persons nominated by the individual
Legislatures, to be of the age of &mdash;&mdash; years at least;
to hold their offices for a term sufficient to ensure their independency;
to receive liberal stipends, by which they may be
compensated for the devotion of their time to public service;
and to be ineligible to any office established by a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
State, or under the authority of the United States, except those
peculiarly belonging to the functions of the second branch,
during the term of service, and for the space of &mdash;&mdash; after the
expiration thereof.</p>

<p>6. Resolved that each branch ought to possess the right of
originating Acts; that the National Legislature ought to be
impowered to enjoy the Legislative Rights vested in Congress
by the Confederation and moreover to legislate in all cases to
which the separate states are incompetent, or in which the
harmony of the United States may be interrupted by the exercise
of individual Legislation; to negative all laws passed by
the several States, contravening in the opinion of the National
Legislature the articles of Union; and to call forth the force
of the Union against any member of the Union failing to fulfill
its duty under the articles thereof.</p>

<p>7. Resd. that a National Executive be instituted; to be
chosen by the National Legislature for the term of &mdash;&mdash; years,
to receive punctually at stated times, a fixed compensation
for the services rendered, in which no increase or diminution
shall be made so as to affect the Magistracy existing at the
time of increase or diminution, and to be ineligible a second
time; and that besides a general authority to execute the
National laws, it ought to enjoy the Executive rights vested in
Congress by the Confederation.</p>

<p>8. Resd. that the Executive and a convenient number of
the National Judiciary, ought to compose a council of revision
with authority to examine every act of the National Legislature
before it shall operate, and every act of a particular Legislature
before a Negative thereon shall be final; and that the
dissent of the said Council shall amount to a rejection, unless
the Act of the National Legislature be again passed, or that
of a particular Legislature be again negatived by &mdash;&mdash; of the
members of each branch.</p>

<p>9. Resd. that a National Judiciary be established to consist
of one or more supreme tribunals, and of inferior tribunals
to be chosen by the National Legislature, to hold their offices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
during good behaviour; and to receive punctually at stated times
fixed compensation for their services, in which no increase or
diminution shall be made so as to affect the persons actually
in office at the time of such increase or diminution that the
jurisdiction of the inferior tribunals shall be to hear and determine
in the first instance, and of the supreme tribunal to
hear and determine in the dernier resort, all piracies and felonies
of the high seas, captures from an enemy; cases in which
foreigners or citizens of other States applying to such jurisdiction
may be interested, or which respect the collection of the
National revenue; impeachments of any National officers, and
questions which may involve the national peace and harmony.</p>

<p>10. Resd. that provision ought to be made for the admission
of States lawfully arising within the limits of the
United States, whether from a voluntary junction of Government
and Territory or otherwise, with the consent of a number
of voices in the National legislature less than the whole.</p>

<p>11. Resd. that a Republican Government and the territory
of each State, except in the instance of a voluntary junction
of Government and territory, ought to be guaranteed by the
United States to each State.</p>

<p>12. Resd. that provision ought to be made for the continuance
of Congress and their authorities and privileges, until a
given day after the reform of the articles of Union shall be
adopted, and for the completion of all their engagements.</p>

<p>13. Resd. that provision ought to be made for the amendment
of the Articles of Union whensoever it shall seem necessary;
and that the assent of the National Legislature ought
not to be required thereto.</p>

<p>14. Resd. that the Legislative Executive and Judiciary
powers within the several States ought to be bound by oath
to support the articles of Union.</p>

<p>15. Resd. that the amendments which shall be offered to
the Confederation by the Convention, ought at a proper time,
or times, after the approbation of Congress to be submitted to
an assembly or assemblies of Representatives, recommended by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
the several Legislatures to be expressly chosen by the people
to consider and decide thereon.</p>


<h4>157. George Mason on the Convention and its Aristocratic Tendencies
(June, 1787)</h4>

<p class="center"><i>George Mason to George Mason, Jr.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Records of the Federal Convention (Farrand), III, 32-33</p></div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, June 1, 1787.</p>

<p>... Virginia has had the honor of presenting the outlines
of the plan upon which the convention is proceeding; but so
slowly that it is impossible to judge when the business will be
finished, most probably not before August&mdash;<i>festina lente</i>
may very well be called our motto. <b><i>When I first came here,
judging from casual conversations with gentlemen from the different
States, I was very apprehensive that, soured and disgusted with the
unexpected evils we had experienced from the democratic principles of
our governments, we should be apt to run into the opposite extreme
and in endeavoring to steer too far from Scylla, we might be drawn
into the vortex of Charybdis, of which I still think there is some
danger</i></b>,<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> though I have the pleasure to find in the convention,
many men of fine republican principles. America has certainly,
upon this occasion, drawn forth her first characters;
there are upon this Convention many gentlemen of the most
respectable abilities, and so far as I can discover, of the purest
intentions. The eyes of the United States are turned upon
this assembly, and their expectations raised to a very anxious
degree....</p>

<p>All communications of the proceedings are forbidden during
the sitting of the Convention; this I think was a necessary
precaution to prevent misrepresentations or mistakes; there
being a material difference between the appearance of a subject
in its first crude and undigested shape, and after it shall have
been properly matured and arranged.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span></p>

<h4>158. The New Jersey Plan</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Records of the Federal Convention</i> (Farrand), I, 242-245 (for June
15). The Convention, in committee of the whole, in two weeks of debate,
had adopted nineteen resolutions based upon the fifteen in the
Virginia Plan above. Action upon this report of the committee of the
whole was then interrupted by the presentation of the following plan on
which the "Small States" had now agreed.</p></div>

<p>Mr. <i>Patterson</i> [New Jersey] laid before the Convention the
plan which he said several of the deputations wished to be
substituted in place of that proposed by Mr. Randolph. After
some little discussion of the most proper mode of giving it a
fair deliberation it was agreed that it should be referred to a
Committee of the Whole, and that in order to place the two
plans in due comparison, the other should be recommitted.
At the earnest desire of Mr. Lansing [New Jersey], and some
other gentlemen, it was also agreed that the Convention should
not go into Committee of the Whole on the subject till tomorrow,
by which delay the friends of the plan proposed by Mr.
Patterson wd. be better prepared to explain and support it, and
all would have an opportunity of taking copies.&mdash;</p>

<p>The propositions from N. Jersey moved by Mr. Patterson
were in the words following.</p>

<p>1. Resd. that the articles of Confederation ought to be so revised,
corrected and enlarged as to render the federal Constitution
adequate to the exigencies of Government, and the preservation
of the Union.</p>

<p>2. Resd. that in addition to the powers vested in the U. States
in Congress, by the present existing articles of Confederation,
they be authorized to pass acts for raising a revenue, by levying
a duty or duties on all goods and merchandizes of foreign
growth or manufacture, imported into any part of the U. States,
by Stamps on paper, vellum or parchment, and by a postage on
all letters or packages passing through the general post-Office,
to be applied to such federal purposes as they shall deem proper
and expedient; to make rules and regulations for the collection
thereof; and the same from time to time to alter and amend in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
such manner as they shall think proper: to pass Acts for the regulation
of trade and commerce as well with foreign nations as
with each other: provided that all punishments, fines, forfeitures
and penalties, to be incurred for contravening such acts rules and
regulations shall be adjudged by the Common law judiciaries of
the State in which any offence contrary to the true intent and
meaning of such Acts rules and regulations shall have been committed
or perpetrated, with liberty of commencing in the first instance
all suits and prosecutions for that purpose in the superior
Common law Judiciary in such State, subject nevertheless,
for the correction of all errors, both in law and fact in rendering
judgment, to an appeal to the Judiciary to the U. States.</p>

<p>3. Resd. that whenever requisitions shall be necessary, instead
of the rule for making requisitions mentioned in the articles
of Confederation, the United States in Congs. be authorized
to make such requisitions in proportion to the whole number of
white and other free citizens and inhabitants of every age sex and
condition including those bound to servitude for a term of years
and three fifths of all other persons not comprehended in the foregoing
description, except Indians not paying taxes; that if such
requisitions be not complied with, in the time specified therein,
to direct the collection thereof in the non complying States and
for that purpose to devise and pass acts directing and authorizing
the same; provided that none of the powers hereby vested
in the U. States in Congs. shall be exercised without the consent
of at least &mdash;&mdash; States, and in that proportion, if the
number of Confederated States should hereafter be increased
or diminished.</p>

<p>4. Resd. that the U. States in Congs. be authorized to elect
a federal Executive to consist of &mdash;&mdash; persons, to continue in
office for the term of &mdash;&mdash; years, to receive punctually at stated
times a fixed compensation for their services, in which no increase
or diminution, shall be made so as to affect the persons

<h4>159. Hamilton's Plan</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On June 18, Hamilton occupied nearly the whole session with an argument
for a government stronger and more centralized even than the
Virginia Plan&mdash;to meet the advocates of the New Jersey Plan by taking
high ground. During this address he presented his own Plan (not what
he thought attainable, but desirable). The paper given below (from
Hamilton's <i>Works</i>, Federalist edition, I, 401 ff.) seems to have been prepared
to assist the delivery of this address, as a sort of brief. The address
itself is reported by Madison (<i>Journal</i>, for June 18) much more at
length, but with many of the same phrases. The student would do well
to compare the two. Copious extracts from that speech, and from other
words of Hamilton in the Convention, are quoted in <i>American History
and Government</i>, &sect; 200.</p></div>

<p>All communities divide themselves into the few and the
many. The first are the rich and well-born; the other, the mass
of the people. ... The people are turbulent and changing;
they seldom judge or determine right. Give therefore to the
first class [the few] a distinct <i>permanent</i> share in the government.
They will check the unsteadiness of the second; and,
as they cannot receive any advantage by a change, they therefore
will ever maintain good government. ... Nothing but a
<i>permanent</i> body can check the imprudence of democracy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
Their turbulent and uncontrollable disposition requires
checks....</p>

<p>It is admitted that you cannot have a good Executive upon
a democratic plan. See the excellency of the British Executive.
He is placed above temptation. He can have no distinct interests
from the public welfare. <b>Nothing short of such an
executive can be efficient. ... Let one body of the Legislature be
constituted during good behavior or life.</b> Let one Executive be
appointed who dares execute his powers. It may be asked:
Is this a republican system? It is strictly so, as long as they
remain elective. And let me observe that an Executive is
less dangerous to the liberties of the people when in office
during life, than for seven years. ... <b>Let electors be appointed
in each of the States to elect the Legislature</b>, to consist of two
branches; and I would give them [the national legislature]
the <i>unlimited power of passing all laws, without exception</i>. The
Assembly to be elected for three years by the people in districts.
The Senate to be elected by electors to be chosen for
that purpose by the people, and to remain in office during life.
<i>The Executive to have the power of negativing all laws</i>; to make
war and peace, with their [Senate's] advice, but to have sole
direction of all military operations, and to send ambassadors,
and appoint all military officers; and to pardon all offenders,
treason excepted, unless by advice of the Senate ... Supreme
judicial officers to be appointed by the Executive and the Senate.</p>

<p>The Legislature to appoint courts in each State, <i>so as to
make the State governments unnecessary to it</i>. All state laws
which contravene the general laws to be absolutely void. <i>An
officer to be appointed in each State to have a negative on all
State laws. ...</i></p>

<p class="center">From New Hampshire.</p>

<p>Mr. Langdon is a man of considerable fortune....</p>

<p class="center">From Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Rufus King, Natl. Gorham, Gerry and Jno. [Caleb] Strong
Esquires.</p>

<p>Mr. King is a Man much distinguished for his eloquence
and great parliamentary talents. He was educated in Massachusetts
and is said to have good classical as well as legal
knowledge. He has served for three years in the Congress of
the United States with great and deserved applause, and is at
this time high in the confidence and approbation of his
Countrymen. This Gentleman is about thirty three years of
age, about five feet ten Inches high, well formed, an handsome
face, with a strong expressive Eye, and a sweet high toned
voice. In his public speaking there is something peculiarly
strong and rich in his expression, clear, and convincing in his
arguments, rapid and irresistible at times in his eloquence but
he is not always equal. His action is natural, swimming and
graceful, but there is a rudeness of manner sometimes accompanying
it. But take him <i>tout en semble</i>, he may with propriety
be ranked among the Luminaries of the present Age.</p>

<p>Mr. Gorham is a Merchant in Boston....</p>

<p>Mr. Gerry's character is marked for integrity and perseverance.
He is a hesitating and laborious speaker;&mdash;possesses a
great degree of confidence and goes extensively into all subjects
that he speaks on, without respect to elegance or flower
of diction. He is connected and sometimes clear in his arguments,
conceives well, and cherishes as his virtue, a love for
his Country. Mr. Gerry is very much of a Gentleman in his
principles and manners;&mdash;he has been engaged in the mercantile
line and is a Man of property. He is about 37 years of age.</p>

<p class="center">From Connecticut.</p>

<p>Saml. Johnson, Roger Sherman, and W. [Oliver] Elsworth
Esquires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Sherman exhibits the oddest shaped character I ever
remember to have met with. He is awkward, un-winning, and
unaccountably strange in his manner. But in his train of
thinking there is something regular, deep and comprehensive;
yet the oddity of his address, the vulgarisms that accompany
his public speaking, and that strange New England cant that
runs through his public as well as his private speaking make
everything that is connected with him grotesque and laughable;&mdash;and
yet he deserves infinite praise,&mdash;no Man has a
better Heart or a clearer Head. If he cannot embellish he
can furnish thoughts that are wise and useful. He is an able
politician and extremely artful in accomplishing any particular
object;&mdash;and it is remarked that he seldom fails. I am told
he sits on the bench in Connecticut, and is very correct in the
discharge of his Judicial functions. In the early part of his
life he was a Shoe-maker;&mdash;but despising the lowness of his
condition, he turned Almanack maker, and so progressed upwards
to a Judge. He has been several years a Member of
Congress, and discharged the duties of his Office with honor
and credit to himself, and advantage to the State he represented.
He is about 60.</p>

<p>Mr. Elsworth is a Judge of the Supreme Court in Connecticut;&mdash;he
is a Gentleman of a clear, deep, and copious understanding;
eloquent, and connected in public debate; and
always attentive to his duty. He is very happy in a reply,
and choice in selecting such parts of his adversary's arguments
as he finds make the strongest impressions,&mdash;in order
to take off the force of them, so as to admit the power of his
own. Mr. Elsworth is about 37 years of age, a Man much
respected for his integrity, and venerated for his abilities.</p>

<p class="center">From New York.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton, [Robert] Yates, and W. [John]
Lansing Esquires.</p>

<p>Colo. Hamilton is deservedly celebrated for his talents.
He is a practitioner of the Law, and reputed to be a finished
Scholar. To a clear and strong judgment he unites the orna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>ments
of fancy, and whilst he is able, convincing, and engaging
in his eloquence the Heart and Head sympathize in
approving him. Yet there is something too feeble in his
voice to be equal to the strains of oratory;&mdash;it is my opinion
that he is rather a convincing Speaker, that [than] a blazing
Orator. Colo. Hamilton requires time to think,&mdash;he enquires
into every part of his subject with the searchings of philosophy,
and when he comes forward he comes highly charged
with interesting matter. There is no skimming over the surface
of a subject with him, he must sink to the bottom to see
what foundation it rests on.&mdash;His language is not always
equal, sometimes didactic like Bolingbroke's at others light
and tripping like Stern's. His eloquence is not so diffusive as
to trifle with the senses, but he rambles just enough to strike
and keep up the attention. He is about 33 years old, of
small stature, and lean. His manners are tinctured with
stiffness, and sometimes with a degree of vanity that is highly
disagreeable.</p>

<p>Mr. Yates is said to be an able Judge. He is a Man of
great legal abilities, but not distinguished as an Orator. Some
of his Enemies say he is an anti-federal Man, but I discovered
no such disposition in him. He is about 45 years old, and
enjoys a great share of health.</p>

<p>Mr. Lansing is a practicing Attorney at Albany, and Mayor
of that Corporation. He has a hesitation in his speech, that
will prevent his being an Orator of any eminence;&mdash;his legal
knowledge I am told is not extensive, nor his education a
good one. He is however a Man of good sense, plain in his
manners, and sincere in his friendships. He is about 32 years
of age.</p>

<p class="center">From New Jersey.</p>

<p>Wm. Livingston, David Brearly, Wm. Patterson, and Jonn.
Dayton, Esquires.</p>

<p>Governor Livingston is confessedly a Man of the first rate
talents, but he appears to me rather to indulge a sportiveness
of wit, than a strength of thinking. He is however equal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
anything, from the extensiveness of his education and genius.
His writings teem with satyr and a neatness of style. But
he is no Orator, and seems little acquainted with the guiles of
policy. He is about 60 years old, and remarkably healthy.</p>

<p>Mr. Brearly is a man of good, rather than of brilliant parts.
He is a Judge of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, and is
very much in the esteem of the people. As an Orator he has
little to boast of, but as a Man he has every virtue to recommend
him. Mr. Brearly is about 40 years of age.</p>

<p>M. Patterson is one of those kind of Men whose powers
break in upon you, and create wonder and astonishment. He
is a Man of great modesty, with looks that bespeak talents
of no great extent,&mdash;but he is a Classic, a Lawyer, and an
Orator;&mdash;and of a disposition so favorable to his advancement
that every one seemed ready to exalt him with their
praises. He is very happy in the choice of time and manner
of engaging in a debate, and never speaks but when he understands
his subject well. This Gentleman is about 34 years
of age, of a very low stature.</p>

<p>Capt. Dayton is a young Gentleman of talents, with ambition
to exert them. He possesses a good education, and
some reading; he speaks well, and seems desirous of improving
himself in Oratory. There is an impetuosity in his temper
that is injurious to him; but there is an honest rectitude
about him that makes him a valuable Member of Society, and
secures to him the esteem of all good Men. He is about 30
years old, served with me as a Brother Aid to General Sullivan
in the Western expedition of '79.</p>

<p class="center">From Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Benja. Franklin, Thos. Mifflin, Robt. Morris, Geo. Clymer,
Thomas Fitzsimmons, Jared Ingersol, James Wilson, Governeur
Morris.</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin is well known to be the greatest philosopher
of the present age;&mdash;all the operations of nature he seems to
understand,&mdash;the very heavens obey him, and the Clouds
yield up their Lightning to be imprisoned in his rod. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
what claim he has to the politician posterity must determine.
It is certain that he does not shine much in public Council,&mdash;he
is no Speaker, nor does he seem to let politics engage his
attention. He is, however, a most extraordinary Man, and
tells a story in a style more engaging that anything I ever
heard. Let his Biographer finish his character. He is 82
years old, and possesses an activity of mind equal to a youth
of 25 years of age.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Robert Morris is a merchant of great eminence and wealth;
an able Financier, and a worthy Patriot. He has an understanding
equal to any public object, and possesses an energy
of mind that few Men can boast of. Although he is not
learned, yet he is as great as those who are. I am told that
when he speaks in the Assembly of Pennsylvania, that he
bears down all before him. What could have been his reason
for not Speaking in the Convention I know not,&mdash;but he never
spoke on any point. This Gentleman is about 50 years of
age....</p>

<p>Mr. Fitzsimmons is a Merchant of considerable talents....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Ingersol is a very able Attorney, and possesses a clear
legal understanding. He is well educated in the Classics
and is a Man of very extensive reading. Mr. Ingersol speaks
well, and comprehends his subject fully. There is a modesty
in his character that keeps him back. He is about 36 years
old.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson ranks among the foremost in legal and political
knowledge. He has joined to a fine genius all that can set
him off and show him to advantage. He is well acquainted
with Man, and understands all the passions that influence him.</p>

<p>Government seems to have been his peculiar Study, all the
political institutions of the World he knows in detail, and
can trace the causes and effects of every revolution from the
earliest stages of the Grecian commonwealth down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
present time. No man is more clear, copious, and comprehensive
than Mr. Wilson, yet he is no great Orator. He draws
the attention not by the charm of his eloquence, but by the
force of his reasoning. He is about 45 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. Governeur Morris is one of those Genius's in whom every
species of talents combine to render him conspicuous and flourishing
in public debate:&mdash;He winds through all the mazes of
rhetoric, and throws around him such a glare that he charms,
captivates, and leads away the senses of all who hear him.
With an infinite stretch of fancy he brings to view things when
he is engaged in deep argument, that render all the labor of
reasoning easy and pleasing. But with all these powers he is
fickle and inconstant,&mdash;never pursuing one train of thinking,&mdash;nor
ever regular. He has gone through a very extensive course
of reading, and is acquainted with all the sciences. No Man
has more wit,&mdash;nor can any one engage the attention more
than Mr. Morris. He was bred to the Law, but I am told he
disliked the profession, and turned merchant. He is engaged
in some great mercantile matters with his namesake Mr. Robt
Morris. This Gentleman is about 38 years old, he has been
unfortunate in losing one of his Legs, and getting all the flesh
taken off his right arm by a scald, when a youth.</p>

<p class="center">From Delaware.</p>

<p>John Dickinson, Gunning Bedford, Geo: Richd. Bassett, and
Jacob Broom Esquires.</p>

<p>Mr. Dickinson has been famed through all America, for his
Farmers Letters; he is a Scholar, and said to be a Man of very
extensive information. When I saw him in the Convention I
was induced to pay the greatest attention to him whenever he
spoke. I had often heard that he was a great Orator, but I
found him an indifferent Speaker. With an affected air of
wisdom he labors to produce a trifle,&mdash;his language is irregular
and incorrect,&mdash;his flourishes (for he sometimes attempts
them), are like expiring flames, they just shew themselves and
go out;&mdash;no traces of them are left on the mind to chear or
animate it. He is, however, a good writer and will ever be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
considered one of the most important characters in the United
States. He is about 55 years old, and was bred a Quaker.</p>

<p>Mr. Bedford was educated for the Bar, and in his profession
I am told has merit. He is a bold and nervous Speaker, and
has a very commanding and striking manner;&mdash;but he is
warm and inpetuous in his temper, and precipitate in his judgment.
[Cf. No. 161.] Mr. Bedford is about 32 years old, and
very corpulent.</p>

good deal of information, but he has a very bad delivery, and
so extremely prolix, that he never speaks without tiring the
patience of all who hear him. He is about 34 years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. Mason is a Gentleman of a remarkable strong powers,
and possesses a clear and copious understanding. He is able
and convincing in debate, steady and firm in his principles,
and undoubtedly one of the best politicians in America. Mr.
Mason is about 60 years old, with a fine strong constitution.</p>

<p>Mr. Maddison is a character who has long been in public
life; and what is very remarkable every Person seems to
acknowledge his greatness. He blends together the profound
politician, with the Scholar. In the management of every
great question he evidently took the lead in the Convention,
and tho' he cannot be called an Orator, he is a most agreable,
eloquent, and convincing Speaker. From a spirit of industry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
and application which he possesses in a most eminent degree,
he always comes forward the best informed Man of any point
in debate. The affairs of the United States, he perhaps, has
the most correct knowledge of, of any Man in the Union. He
has been twice a Member of Congress, and was always thought
one of the ablest Members that ever sat in that Council. Mr.
Maddison is about 37 years of age, a Gentleman of great modesty,&mdash;with
a remarkable sweet temper. He is easy and unreserved
among his acquaintances, and has a most agreable
style of conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. Blair is one of the most respectable Men in Virginia
both on account of his Family as well as his fortune....</p>

<p>Mr. Randolph is Governor of Virginia,&mdash;a young Gentleman
in whom unite all the accomplishments of the Scholar,
and the States-man. He came forward with the postulata or
first principles, on which the Convention acted, and he supported
them with a force of eloquence and reasoning that did
him great honor. He has a most harmonious voice, a fine
person and striking manners. Mr. Randolph is about 32 years
of age.</p>

is about 36 years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. Spaight is a worthy Man, of some abilities, and fortune.

<p>Mr. Rutledge is one of those characters who was highly
mounted at the commencement of the late revolution; his
reputation in the first Congress gave him a distinguished rank
among the American Worthies. He was bred to the Law, and
now acts as one of the Chancellors of South Carolina. This
Gentleman is much famed in his own State as an Orator, but
in my opinion he is too rapid in his public speaking to be
denominated an agreeable Orator. He is undoubtedly a man
of abilities, and a Gentleman of distinction and fortune. Mr.
Rutledge was once Governor of South Carolina. He is about
48 years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. Chas. Cotesworth Pinckney is a Gentleman of Family
and fortune....</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Pinckney is a young Gentleman of most promising

<p>Mr. Baldwin is a Gentleman of superior abilities, and joins

<p>Mr. Houstoun is an Attorney at Law. ... He is a Gentleman

<h4>161. One Day in the Philadelphia Convention</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Madison's <i>Journal</i>. The day chosen was the closing day of debate
on the "Connecticut Compromise" proposition, when the Convention
came near disruption. For the narrative, cf. <i>American History and
Government</i>, &sect; 203.</p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday, June</span> 30th</p>

<p><i>In Convention,</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Brearly</span> [New Jersey]<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> moved that
the President write to the Executive of New Hampshire, informing
it that the business depending before the Convention
was of such a nature as to require the immediate attendance
of the Deputies of that State. In support of his motion, he
observed that the difficulties of the subject, and the diversity
of opinions called for all the assistance we could possibly
obtain. (It was well understood that the object was to add
New Hampshire to the number of States opposed to the
doctrine of proportional representation, which it was presumed,
from her relative size, she must be adverse to.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span> [New Jersey] seconded the motion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rutledge</span> [South Carolina] could see neither the
necessity nor propriety of such a measure. They are not
unapprised of the meeting, and can attend if they choose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span></p>
<p>Rhode Island might as well be urged to appoint and send
deputies. Are we to suspend the business until the Deputies
arrive? If we proceed, he hoped all the great points would
be adjusted before the letter could produce its effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span> [Massachusetts] said he had written more than
once as a private correspondent, and the answer gave him
every reason to expect that State would be represented very
shortly, if it should be so at all. Circumstances of a personal
nature had hitherto prevented it. A letter could have no
effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> [Pennsylvania] wished to know, whether it
would be consistent with rule or reason of secrecy, to communicate
to New Hampshire that the business was of such a
nature as the motion described. It would spread a great alarm.
Besides he doubted the propriety of soliciting any State on
the subject, the meeting being merely voluntary.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. <span class="smcap">Brearly</span>.</p>

<p>New York, New Jersey, aye&mdash;2; Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, no&mdash;5;
Maryland divided; Pennsylvania, Delaware, Georgia, not on
the floor.</p>

<p>The motion of Mr. <span class="smcap">Ellsworth</span> being resumed, for allowing
each State an equal vote in the second branch,&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> did not expect such a motion after the establishment
of the contrary principle in the first branch; and
considering the reasons which would oppose it, even if an
equal vote had been allowed in the first branch. The gentleman
from Connecticut (Mr. <span class="smcap">Ellsworth</span>) had pronounced,
that if the motion should not be acceded to, of all the States
north of Pennsylvania one only would agree to any General
Government. He entertained more favourable hopes of Connecticut
and of the other Northern States. He hoped the
alarms exceeded their cause, and that they would not abandon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>a country to which they were bound by so many strong and
endearing ties. But should the deplored event happen, it
would neither stagger his sentiments nor his duty. <i>If the
minority of the people of America refuse to coalesce with the
majority on just and proper principles; if a separation must
take place, it could never happen on better grounds.</i> The votes
of yesterday against the just principle of representation were
as twenty-two to ninety of the people of America. Taking
the opinions to be the same on this point, and he was sure,
if there was any room for change, it could not be on the side
of the majority, the question will be, shall less than one-fourth
of the United States withdraw themselves from the Union, or
shall more than three-fourths renounce the inherent, indisputable
and unalienable rights of men, in favor of the artificial
system of States? If issue must be joined, it was on this
point he would choose to join it. The gentleman from Connecticut,
in supposing that the preponderance secured to the
majority in the first branch had removed the objections to an
equality of votes in the second branch for the security of the
minority, narrowed the case extremely. Such an equality will
enable the minority to control, in all cases whatsoever, the
sentiments and interests of the majority. Seven States will
control six: seven States, according to the estimates that had
been used, composed twenty-four ninetieths of the whole
people. It would be in the power, then, of less than one-third
to overrule two-thirds, whenever a question should happen to
divide the States in that manner....</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ellsworth</span>. The capital objection of Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, "that
the minority will rule the majority," is not true. <b><i>The power is
given to the few to save them from being destroyed by the many.</i></b> If
an equality of votes had been given to them in both branches,
the objection might have weight. Is it a novel thing that the
few should have a check on the many? Is it not the case in
the British Constitution, the wisdom of which so many gentlemen
have united in applauding? Have not the House of
Lords, who form so small a proportion of the nation, a negative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
on the laws, as a necessary defence of their peculiar rights
against the encroachments of the Commons? No instance of
a confederacy has existed in which an equality of voices has
not been exercised by the members of it. We are running from
one extreme to another. We are razing the foundations of the
building, when we need only repair the roof. No salutary
measure has been lost for want of <i>a majority of the States</i>
to favor it. If security be all that the great States wish for,
the first branch secures them. The danger of combinations
among them is not imaginary. Although no particular abuses
could be foreseen by him the possibility of them would be sufficient
to alarm him. But he could easily conceive cases in
which they might result from such combinations. Suppose,
that, in pursuance of some commercial treaty or arrangement,
three or four free ports and no more were to be established,
would not combinations be formed in favor of Boston, Philadelphia,
and some port of the Chesapeake? A like concert might
be formed in the appointment of the great offices. He appealed
again to <b><i>the obligations of the Federal compact</i></b> [Articles of Confederation]
<b><i>in force</i></b>, and which had been entered <b><i>into with so much solemnity;
persuading himself that some regard would still be paid to the
plighted faith under which each State, small as well as great, held an
equal right of suffrage in the general councils</i></b>. His remarks were
not the result of partial or local views. The State he represented
(Connecticut) held a middle rank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Madison</span> did justice to the able and close reasoning of
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ellsworth</span>, but must observe that it did not always
accord with itself. On another occasion, the large States were
described by him as the aristocratic States, ready to oppress
the small. Now the small are the House of Lords, requiring
a negative to defend them against the more numerous Commons.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ellsworth</span> had also erred in saying that no instance
had existed in which confederated states had not retained
to themselves a perfect equality of suffrage. Passing over the
German system, in which the King of Prussia has nine voices,
he reminded Mr. <span class="smcap">Ellsworth</span> of the Lycian confederacy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
in which the component members had votes proportioned to
their importance, and which Montesquieu recommends as the
fittest model for that form of government. Had the fact been
as stated by Mr. <span class="smcap">Ellsworth</span>, it would have been of little
avail to him, or rather would have strengthened the arguments
against him; the history and fate of the several confederacies,
modern as well as ancient, demonstrating some radical vice in
their structure. In reply to the appeal of Mr. <span class="smcap">Ellsworth</span>
to the faith plighted in the existing federal compact, he remarked,
that the party claiming from others an adherence to a
common engagement, ought at least to be guiltless itself of a
violation. Of all the States, however, Connecticut was perhaps
least able to urge this plea. Besides the various omissions to
perform the stipulated acts, from which no State was free, the
Legislature of that State had, by a pretty recent vote, <i>positively
refused</i> to pass a law for complying with the requisitions of
Congress, and transmitted a copy of the vote to Congress.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> It
was urged, he said, continually, that an equality of votes in the
second branch was not only necessary to secure the small, but
would be perfectly safe to the large ones; whose majority in the
first branch was an effectual bulwark. But notwithstanding
this apparent defence, the majority of States might still injure
the majority of the people. ... He admitted that every peculiar
interest, whether in any class of citizens or any description
of States, ought to be secured as far as possible. Wherever
there is danger of attack, there ought to be given a constitutional
power of defence. <b>But he contended that the States
were divided into different interests, not by their difference of size,
but other circumstances; the most material of which resulted
partly from climate, but principally from the effects of their having
or not having slaves. These two causes concurred in forming
the great division of interests in the United States. It did not lie
between the large and small States. It lay between the Northern
and Southern. ...</b></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ellsworth</span> assured the House, that, whatever might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
thought of the Representatives of Connecticut, the State was
entirely Federal in her disposition. He appealed to her great
exertions during the war, in supplying both men and money.
<i>The muster-rolls would show she had more troops in the field than
Virginia.</i><a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> If she had been delinquent, it had been from inability,
and not more so than other States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Madison</span> animadverted on the delinquency
of the States, when his object required him to prove
that the constitution of Congress was faulty. Congress is not
to blame for the faults of the States. Their measures have
been right, and the only thing wanting has been a further
power in Congress to render them effectual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davie</span> [North Carolina] was much embarrassed, and
wished for explanations. The Report of the Committee [of
the Whole], allowing the Legislatures to choose the Senate, and
establishing a proportional representation in it, seemed to be
impracticable. There will, according to this rule, be ninety
members in the outset, and the number will increase as new
States are added. It was impossible that so numerous a body
could possess the activity and other qualities required in it.
Were he to vote on the comparative merits of the Report, as it
stood, and the amendment, he should be constrained to prefer
the latter. ... Under this view of the subject, he could not
vote for any plan for the Senate yet proposed. He thought
that, in general, there were extremes on both sides. <i>We were
partly federal, partly national, in our union</i>; and he did not see
why the Government might not in some respects operate on
the States, in others on the people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> admitted the question concerning the number
of Senators to be embarrassing. If the smallest States be
allowed one, and the others in proportion, the Senate will
certainly be too numerous. He looked forward to the time
when the smallest States will contain a hundred thousand
souls at least. Let there be then one Senator in each, for
every hundred thousand souls, and let the States not having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>that number of inhabitants be allowed one. He was willing
himself to submit to this temporary concession to the small
States; and threw out the idea as a ground of compromise....</p>

<p>Doctor <span class="smcap">Franklin</span>. The diversity of opinions turns on two
points. If a proportional representation takes place, the
small States contend that their liberties will be in danger. If
an equality of votes is to be put in its place, the large States
say their money will be in danger. When a broad table is to
be made, and the edges of planks do not fit, the artist takes a
little from both, and makes a good joint. In like manner,
here, both sides must part from some of their demands, in
order that they may join in some accommodating proposition.
He had prepared one which he would read, that it might lie
on the table for consideration. The proposition was in the
words following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"That the Legislatures of the several States shall choose and send an
equal number of delegates, namely ..., who are to compose the second
branch of the General Legislature.</p>

<p>"That in all cases or questions wherein the sovereignty of individual
States may be affected, or whereby their authority over their own citizens
may be diminished, or the authority of the General Government within
the several States augmented, each State shall have equal suffrage.</p>

<p>"That in the appointment of all civil officers of the General Government,
in the election of whom the second branch may by the constitution
have part, each State shall have equal suffrage.</p>

<p>"That in fixing the salaries of such officers, and in all allowances for
public services, and generally in all appropriations and disposition of
money to be drawn out of the general Treasury; and in all laws for supplying
that Treasury, the Delegates of the several States shall have suffrage
in proportion to the sums which their respective States do actually
contribute to the Treasury."</p></div>

<p>Where a ship had many owners, this was the rule of deciding
on her expedition. He had been one of the ministers from
this country to France during the joint war, and would have
been very glad if allowed to vote in distributing the money to
carry it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span> observed, that the simple question was, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
each State should have an equal vote in the second branch;
that it must be apparent to those gentlemen who liked neither
the motion for this quality, nor the Report as it stood, that
the Report was as susceptible of melioration as the motion;
that a reform would be nugatory and nominal only, if we should
make another Congress of the proposed Senate; that if the
adherence to an equality of votes was fixed and unalterable,
there could not be less obstinacy on the other side; and that
<b><i>we were in fact cut asunder already, and it was in vain to shut our
eyes against it</i></b>. That he was, however, filled with astonishment,
that, if we were convinced that every <i>man</i> in America was
secured in all his rights, we should be ready to sacrifice this
substantial good to the phantom of <i>State</i> sovereignty. That
his feelings were more harrowed and his fears more agitated
for his country than he could express; that he conceived this
to be the last opportunity of providing for its liberty and happiness:
that he could not, therefore, but repeat his amazement,
that when a just government, founded on a fair representation
of the <i>People</i> of America, was within our reach, we should renounce
the blessing, from an attachment to the ideal freedom
and importance of <i>States</i>. That should this wonderful illusion
continue to prevail, his mind was prepared for any event, rather
than sit down under a Government founded on a vicious principle
of representation, and which must be as short-lived as it
would be unjust. He might prevail on himself to accede to
some such expedient as had been hinted by Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>; but
<b><i>he never could listen to an equality of votes, as proposed in the motion</i></b>.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dayton</span>. <b><i>When assertion is given for proof, and terror substituted
for argument, he presumed they would have no effect, however
eloquently spoken.</i></b> It should have been shown that the evils we
have experienced have proceeded from the equality now objected
to; and that the seeds of dissolution for the State Governments
are not sown in the General Government. He considered
the system on the table [Virginia Plan] as a novelty,
an amphibious monster; and was persuaded that it never would
be received by the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span> [Maryland] <b><i>would never confederate, if it could not
be done on just principles</i></b> [<i>i.e.</i>, giving small States equal voice in
at least one House].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Madison</span> would acquiesce in the concession hinted by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, on condition that a due independence should
be given to the Senate. The plan in its present shape makes
the Senate absolutely dependent on the States. The Senate,
therefore, is only another edition of Congress. He knew the
faults of that body, and had used a bold language against it.
Still he would preserve the State rights as carefully as the
trial by jury.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bedford</span> [Delaware] contended, that there was no
middle way between a perfect consolidation, and a mere
confederacy of the States. The first is out of the question;
and in the latter they must continue, if not perfectly, yet
<i>equally</i>, sovereign. If political societies possess ambition,
avarice, and all the other passions which render them formidable
to each other, ought we not to view them in this light
here? Will not the same motives operate in America as
elsewhere? If any gentleman doubts it, let him look at
the votes. Have they not been dictated by interest, by ambition?
<b><i>Are not the large States evidently seeking to aggrandize
themselves at the expense of the small?</i></b> They think, no doubt,
that they have right on their side, but interest has blinded
their eyes. Look at Georgia. Though a small State at
present, she is actuated by the prospect of soon being a great
one. South Carolina is actuated both by present interest, and
future prospects. She hopes, too, to see the other States cut
down to her own dimensions. North Carolina has the same
motives of present and future interest. Virginia follows.
Maryland is not on that side of the question. Pennsylvania
has a direct and future interest. Massachusetts has a decided
and palpable interest in the part she takes. ... <b><i>The three
large States have a common interest to bind them together in commerce.</i></b>
But whether a combination, as we supposed, shall take place
among them, in either case the small States must be ruined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
We must, like Solon, make such a government as the people
will approve. Will the smaller States ever agree to the
proposed degradation of them? It is not true that the people
will not agree to enlarge the powers of the present Congress.
The language of the people has been, that Congress
ought to have the power of collecting an impost, and of
coercing the States where it may be necessary. On the first
point they have been explicit, and, in a manner, unanimous
in their declarations. And must they not agree to this, and
similar measures, if they ever mean to discharge their engagements?
The little States are willing to observe their engagements,
<i><b>but will meet the large ones on no ground but that of the
Confederation. We have been told, with dictatorial air, this is the
last moment for a fair trial in favor of a good government. It will
be the last, indeed, if the propositions reported from the Committee go
forth to the people. He was under no apprehensions. The large
States dare not dissolve the Confederation.</b> If they do, the small
ones will find some foreign ally, of more honour and good faith,
who will take them by the hand, and do them justice.</i> He did not
mean, by this, to intimidate or alarm. It was a natural consequence,
which ought to be avoided by enlarging the Federal
powers, not annihilating the Federal system. This is what the
people expect. All agree in the necessity of a more efficient
government, and why not make such an one as they desire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ellsworth</span>. Under a National Government, he should
participate in the national security, as remarked by Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>;
but that was all. What he wanted was domestic happiness.
The National Government could not descend to the local
objects on which this depended. It could only embrace objects
of a general nature. He turned his eyes, therefore, for the
preservation of his rights, to the State Governments. From
these alone he could derive the greatest happiness he expects
in this life. His happiness depends on their existence, as much
as a new-born infant on its mother for nourishment. If this
reasoning was not satisfactory, he had nothing to add that could
be so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span> was for preserving the States in a subordinate degree,
and as far as they could be necessary for the purposes
stated by Mr. <span class="smcap">Ellsworth</span>. He did not think a full answer
had been given to those who apprehended a dangerous encroachment
on their jurisdictions. ... He could not sit down without
taking some notice of the language of the honorable gentleman
from Delaware (Mr. <span class="smcap">Bedford</span>). It was not he [King]
that had uttered a dictatorial language. This intemperance
had marked the honorable gentleman himself. It was not he
[King] who, with a vehemence unprecedented in that House,
had declared himself ready to turn his hopes from our common
country, and court the protection of some foreign hand.
This, too, was the language of the honorable member himself.
He was grieved that such an expression had dropped from
his lips. The gentleman could only excuse it to himself on
the score of passion. For himself, <i>whatever might be his distress,
he would never court relief from a foreign power</i>.</p>

<h4>162. George Mason's Objections to the Constitution, 1787</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Kate Mason Rowland's <i>Life of George Mason</i> (1892), II, 387-390.</p>

<p>Mason had been one of the most enthusiastic of the Philadelphia Convention
in its early stages, writing to his son, after a few weeks, that he
would "bury my bones in Philadelphia" rather than injure the business
by leaving prematurely, though his private affairs were pressing. But he
was more democratic than the Convention, and, before its close, he came
to look upon the results with suspicion. He refused to sign the completed
constitution, and afterward he opposed its ratification in Virginia. Mason
was the chief author of the Virginia Bill of Rights of 1776 (No. 136
above). Cf. also No. 163.</p></div>

<p><i>There is no Declaration of Rights</i>, and, the laws of the
general government being paramount to the laws and constitution
of the several States, the Declaration of Rights in the
separate States are no security. <i>Nor are the people secured
even in the enjoyment of the benefit of the common law.</i></p>

<p>In the House of Representatives there is not the substance
but the shadow only of representation; which can never
produce proper information in the legislature, or inspire
confidence in the people; the laws will therefore be generally
made by men little concerned in, and unacquainted with their
effects and consequences.</p>

<p>The Senate have the power of altering all money bills, and
of originating appropriations of money, and the salaries of
the officers of their own appointment, in conjunction with the
president of the United States, although they are not the
representatives of the people or amenable to them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span></p>
<p>These with their other great powers (viz.: their power in the
appointment of ambassadors and all public officers; in making
treaties, and in trying all impeachments; their influence upon
and connection with the supreme Executive from these
causes; their duration of office and their being a constantly
existing body, almost continually sitting; joined with their
being one complete branch of the legislature) will destroy any
balance in the government, and enable them to accomplish
what usurpations they please upon the rights and liberties
of the people.</p>

<p>The Judiciary of the United States is so constructed and
extended, as to absorb and destroy the judiciaries of the
several States; thereby rendering law as tedious, intricate and
expensive, and justice as unattainable, by a great part of the
community, as in England, and enabling the rich to oppress
and ruin the poor.</p>

<p>The President of the United States has no Constitutional
Council, a thing unknown in any safe and regular government.
He will therefore be unsupported by proper information and
advice, and will generally be directed by minions and favorites;
or he will become a tool to the Senate&mdash;or a Council
of State will grow out of the principal officers of the great
departments; the worst and most dangerous of all ingredients
for such a Council in a free country. From this fatal defect
has arisen the improper power of the Senate in the appointment
of public officers, and the alarming dependence and
connection between that branch of the legislature and the
supreme Executive.</p>

<p>Hence also sprung that unnecessary officer the Vice-President,
who for want of other employment is made president
of the Senate, thereby dangerously blending the executive
and legislative powers, besides always giving to some one of
the States an unnecessary and unjust preeminence over the
others.</p>

<p>The President of the United States has the unrestrained
power of granting pardons for treason, which may be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>times
exercised to screen from punishment those whom he
had secretly instigated to commit the crime, and thereby
prevent a discovery of his own guilt.</p>

<p>By declaring all treaties supreme laws of the land, the Executive
and the Senate have, in many cases, an exclusive power
of legislation; which might have been avoided by proper distinctions
with respect to treaties, and requiring the assent of
the House of Representatives, where it could be done with
safety.</p>

<p>By requiring only a majority to make all commercial and
navigation laws, the five Southern States, whose produce and
circumstances are totally different from that of the eight Northern
and Eastern States, may be ruined, for such rigid and premature
regulations may be made as will enable the merchants
of the Northern and Eastern States not only to demand an exorbitant
freight, but to monopolize the purchase of the commodities
at their own price, for many years, to the great injury
of the landed interest, and impoverishment of the people; and
the danger is the greater as the gain on one side will be in proportion
to the loss on the other. Whereas requiring two-thirds
of the members present in both Houses would have
produced mutual moderation, promoted the general interest,
and removed an insuperable objection to the adoption of this
government.</p>

the enumerated powers</i></b>,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> the Congress may grant monopolies in
trade and commerce, constitute new crimes, inflict unusual and
severe punishments, and extend their powers as far as they
shall think proper; so that the State legislatures have no security
for the powers now presumed to remain to them, or the
people for their rights.</p>

<p>The State legislatures are restrained from laying export
duties on their own produce.</p>

<p>Both the general legislature and the State legislature are expressly
prohibited making <i>ex post facto</i> laws; though there
never was nor can be a legislature but must and will make such
laws, when necessity and the public safety require them; which
will hereafter be a breach of all the constitutions in the Union,
and afford precedents for other innovations.</p>

<p><b>This government will set out a moderate aristocracy</b>: it is at
present impossible to foresee whether it will, in its operation,
produce a monarchy, or a corrupt, tyrannical aristocracy; it
will most probably vibrate some years between the two, and
then terminate in the one or the other.</p>

<p>The general legislature is restrained from prohibiting the
further importation of slaves for twenty odd years; though
such importations render the United States weaker, more
vulnerable, and less capable of defence.</p>

<p>I make no Doubt that You have long ago received Copies of
the new Constitution. ... Upon the most mature consideration
I was capable of, and from Motives of sincere Patriotism,
I was under the Necessity of refusing my Signature, as one
of the Virginia Delegates; and drew up some general Objections;
which I intended to offer, by way of Protest; but
was discouraged from doing so, by the precipitate and intemperate,
not to say indecent, Manner, in which the Business
was conducted during the last week of the Convention,
after the Patrons of this New Plan formed they had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>

Compromise between the Eastern and the two Southern States,

twenty odd years; a more favorite Object with them than the

in the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention of 1788</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Writings of Laco</i>, VII, 23 ff. (a series of "Letters" published by Stephen
Higginson and other Federalists, in 1789, to defeat Hancock in his candidacy
for re&euml;lection to the governorship). Higginson was a Boston merchant,
and a leading Federalist. The "plan" he refers to as placed in
Hancock's hands, favored the adoption of the Constitution with a list of
amendments to be adopted later by the new government.</p></div>

<p>There are men in every free society, who have not a common
interest with the community at large; and who rely wholly
on the popular affection in their favour, to give them promotion
and support in publick life. ... Without abilities to make
them really useful in publick life, and devoid of principles or
merits that can command respect, they have no dependence
but upon popular attention to bring them into view; and,
having been long attentive to the popular pulse, and always
acquainted with the darling object with the multitude for the
time, they rarely fail to touch the right string, and to make
the people subserve their own selfish and private views. ...
There cannot be found within the compass of our memory, an
instance, so strongly verifying the preceding observation, as
that of Mr. H. and his adhering dependents....</p>

<p>... The course of his conduct from his reassuming the
chair, to the meeting of our State Convention, for considering
and adopting the new form of government for the Union, was
nothing more than a renewed exhibition of the same levities,
and a uniform preference of his own private interest, to that
of the public.</p>

<p>A scene now opens upon us, very interesting and important:&mdash;The
objects which [were] then presented for our considera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>tion,
were so novel, and of such magnitude, as deservedly
engrossed the feelings and the attention of every man. No
one could remain mute and indifferent, while the question
as to the New Constitution was pending; and every one,
who felt no other bias than a regard to the safety and happiness
of our country, ... was most anxiously solicitous
for its adoption. But the popular demagogues, and those
[who] were very much embarrassed in their affairs, united to
oppose it with all their might; and they laboured incessantly,
night and day, to alarm the simple and credulous, by insinuating,
that, however specious its appearance, and that of its
advocates, tyranny and vassalage would result from its principles.
The former of those descriptions were conscious, that
a stable and efficient government would deprive them of all
future importance, or support from the publick; and the latter
of them knew, that nothing but weakness and convulsions in
government could screen them from payment of their debts.
How far Mr. H. was influenced by either, or both of those
motives, it is not easy to determine; but no one, who recollects
his general habits, who knows his situation and views,
and was acquainted with the open conversation and conduct of
his cabinet counsellors, can have a doubt of his being opposed
to it. We all know, that Mr. Quondam, and Mr. Changeling,
as well as the <i>once venerable old Patriot</i> [Samuel Adams], who,
by a notable defection, has lately thrown himself into the
arms of Mr. H. in violation of every principle; and for the
paltry privilege of sharing in his smiles, has, at the eve of
life, cast an indelible stain over his former reputation&mdash;it is
well known, I say, that these men do not dare to speak in
publick a language opposite to that of their patron; and it is
equally notorious, that they were open in their opposition to
the Constitution&mdash;They even went so far as to vilify its compilers,
that they might thence draw an argument to support
their suggestions of its containing the seeds of latent tyranny
and oppression. They endeavoured by every possible mean in
their power, to create a popular clamour against the Constitu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>tion;
but they failed in their attempt; and Mr. H. and his
friends were obliged, upon their own principles to grow more
cautious in their opposition. The good sense of the <i>Mechanicks
of Boston</i> had produced some manly and spirited resolutions,
which effectually checked Mr. H. and his followers in their
opposition to the Constitution; and eventually occasioned <i>four</i>
votes in its favour, which otherwise would have been most
certainly against it. Had those resolutions not made their
appearance, Mr. H. and three others of our Delegates would
have been in the negative; but it was thought necessary by
them, after they had appeared, to vote in favour of it. Having
settled this point, the next thing was to do it with a good
grace, and to profit as much by it as they could; and Mr. H.
accordingly intimated to the advocates for the adoption, that
he would appear in its favour, if they would make it worth
his while. This intimation was given through a common
friend, who assured the friends of the Constitution, that
nothing more would be required on the part of Mr. H. than a
promise to support him in the chair at the next election. This
promise, though a bitter pill, was agreed to be given; for such
was the state of things, that they were very much afraid to
decide upon the question, whilst he was opposed to it. The
famous conciliatory proposition of Mr. H. as it was called, was
then prepared by the advocates, and adopted by him; but the
truth is, he never was consulted about it, nor knew its contents,
before it was handed to him to bring forward in Convention.
At the appointed time, Mr. H. with all the parade of an
Arbiter of States, came out with the motion, not only in the
words, but the very original paper that was given him; and,
with a confidence astonishing to all who were in the secret, he
called it his own, and said it was the result of his own reflections
on the subject, in the short intervals of ease which he
had enjoyed, during a most painful disorder. In this pompous
and farcical manner did he make that famous proposition,
upon which he and his adherents have arrogated so much;
but neither he nor they have any other merit in the case, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
an attempt to deceive both parties can fairly entitle them.
For, at the very time he was buoying up the hopes of the
advocates, he was assuring the opposers of the Constitution,
by his emissaries, that he was really adverse to it; and upon
the strictest scrutiny we cannot find that any one vote was
gained by his being ostensibly in favour of it. The votes of
the Old Patriot, and Mr. Changeling, and Mr. Joyce, jun. we
know were determined in its favour by the resolutions of the
Mechanicks; but the votes of many others, who used implicitly
to follow Mr. H. were in the negative, which were counted
upon by the friends of the Constitution, as being certain on
their side. This is a strong confirmation that Mr. H. was
then playing a game, which these people well understood;
and indeed they, some of them, explicitly declared it at the
time. His subsequent conduct, in regard to amendments, is a
clear proof also, that by appearing in its favour in Convention,
he did not mean to support it; and that he was not serious
when he declared his proposition to be only conciliatory, and
not to remedy any defects existing in his mind in the constitution
as reported, which he explicitly declared at the time
was the case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 1. The executive Power shall be vested in a President
of the United States of America. He shall hold his
Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the
Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:</p>

<p>Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature
thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole
Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State
may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative,
or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under
the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.</p>

<p>[The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote
by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be
an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they
shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number
of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify,
and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the
United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The
President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate
and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and
the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the
greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number
be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed;
and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and
have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives
shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President;
and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five
highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse
the President. But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be
taken by States, the Representation from each State having
one Vote; A quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of
all the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case,
after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest
Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President.
But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes,
the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President.]<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors,

the Office of President of the United States, and will to
the best of my Ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution

them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn
them to such Time as he shall think proper; he shall
receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take
Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission

<p class="center">ARTICLE III</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 1. The judicial Power of the United States, shall

The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall

only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(On the appellate jurisdiction, cf. <i>American History and Government</i>,
&sect;&sect; 207 <i>a</i> and 217. Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, still in force,
defines that jurisdiction as follows:</p>

<p>"<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That a final judgment or decree in any
suit, in the highest court of law or equity of a State in which a decision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>in the suit could be had, when is drawn in question the validity of a
treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States,
and the decision is against their validity; or when is drawn in question
the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under, any State, on
the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws
of the United States, and the decision is in favor of such their validity;
or when is drawn in question the construction of any clause of the Constitution,
or of a treaty, or statute of, or commission held under, the
United States, and the decision is against the title, right, privilege, or
exemption, especially set up or claimed ... under such clause of the
said Constitution, treaty, statute, or commission, may be re-examined,
and revised or affirmed in the Supreme Court of the United States upon
a writ of error. ..."</p>

<p>On the establishment of "inferior courts," cf. <i>American History and
Government</i>, &sect; 217. Such courts at present (1913) are from the bottom
up:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>District Courts.</i> Over ninety in 1911; the law of 1789 provided for
thirteen.</p>

<p>2. <i>Circuit Courts.</i> Nine, each three justices. The first law, 1789,
provided three circuit courts, but no special circuit judges; a circuit court
then consisted of a justice of the Supreme Court "or circuit" and one or
more judges of district courts included within the circuit. This remained
the rule with a brief attempt at change in 1801, as described in &sect; 240, until
1866, when separate circuit justices were provided.</p>

<p>3. <i>Circuit Courts of Appeals.</i> One for each of the nine circuits, composed
of a justice of the Supreme Court and of other Federal judges&mdash;not
less than three in all, and not including any justice from whose decision
the appeal is taken. This order of courts was instituted in 1891, to
relieve the Supreme Court which was then hopelessly overburdened with
appeals from lower courts. In most cases, now, the decision of the circuit
court of appeals is final.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Supreme Court.</i> One Chief Justice and eight Associate
Justices. Its business now is confined very largely to those supremely
important matters specified in the Constitution and in the law of 1789
quoted above.</p>

<p>There are also three special courts, somewhat outside this system: (1)
the Federal <i>Court of Claims</i>, to determine money claims against the
United States, established in 1855; (2) <i>Court of Customs Appeals</i>,
established in 1909; and (3) <i>the Commerce Court</i>, created in 1910, to
revise the work of the Interstate Commerce Commission.)</p></div>

next after the first Monday in November" in each even-numbered year; and
a law of 1871 had already ordered that all such elections should be by ballot.
An Act of 1866 provided a uniform method of electing Senators: the legislation
of each state (in which such an election is to be made) to vote first <i>in
separate Houses</i>, and, if no one candidate received a majority in each House,
then thereafter in <i>joint</i> session, taking at least one ballot daily until some
candidate received a majority, or until the legislative session came to an end
without an election. Forty-seven years later (1913), this law was superseded
by the Seventeenth Amendment.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_171" id="Footnote_171"></a><a href="#FNanchor_171"><span class="label">[171]</span></a> The first veto provision in a State Constitution (New York, 1777) ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Section III. And whereas laws inconsistent with the spirit of this constitution,
or with the public good, may be hastily and unadvisedly passed: Be it
ordained that the governor for the time being, the chancellor, and the judges
of the supreme court, or any two of them together with the governor, shall be
and hereby are constituted a council to revise all bills about to be passed into
laws by the legislature. ... [Provision for veto procedure and reconsideration
in language essentially the same as in Massachusetts provision given
below.]</p>
<p>"And in order to prevent unnecessary delays, be it further ordained that
if any bill shall not be returned by the council within ten days after it shall
have been presented, the same shall be a law, unless the Legislature shall, by
their adjournment, render a return of the said bill within ten days impracticable;
in which case the bill shall be returned on the first day of the Legislature
after the expiration of the ten days."</p>
<p>The Veto Provision in the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 ran:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Article II. No bill or resolve of the senate or house of representatives
shall become a law, and have force as such, until it shall have been laid before
the governor for his revisal; and if he, upon such revision, approve thereof,
he shall signify his approbation by signing the same. But if he have any
objection to the passing of such bill or resolve, he shall return the same, together
with his objections thereto, in writing, to the senate or house of representatives,
in whatsoever the same shall have originated, who shall enter the
objections sent down by the governor, at large, on their records, and proceed
to reconsider the said bill or resolve; but if after such reconsideration, two-thirds
of the said senate or house of representatives shall, notwithstanding
the objections, agree to pass the same, it shall, together with the objections,
be sent to the other branch of the legislature, when it shall also be reconsidered,
and if approved by two-thirds of the members present, shall have the
force of law; but in all such cases, the vote of both houses shall be determined
by yeas and nays; and the names of the persons voting for or against the said
bill or resolve shall be entered upon the public records of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>"And in order to prevent unnecessary delays, if any bill or resolve shall not
be returned by the governor within five days after it shall have been presented,
the same shall have the force of law."</p>
<p>The Virginia Plan recommended essentially the New York method. The
Massachusetts delegates at Philadelphia, however, contended strenuously for
the plan in use in their State, and finally carried their point. The "pocket-veto"
clause (the last provision of the text above) was original in the Federal
Constitution.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_173" id="Footnote_173"></a><a href="#FNanchor_173"><span class="label">[173]</span></a> Citizenship, in practice, comes by birth or by admission by a court of
record under authority of a law of Congress. Two classes of people are citizens
by birth: (1) according to the Fourteenth Amendment, all who are born
within the limits of the United States (except children of official representatives
of foreign states, of a foreign army occupying part of our territory);
(2) according to a law of Congress, all who are born of parents who are American
citizens but who were temporarily residing abroad. No one not included
in one of the above classes can become a citizen except by (1) a special Act
of Congress, or (2) by admission by a court of record under authority of the
general law passed by Congress. That law has varied from time to time (cf.
index, for some of the more important variations); but the usual period of
residence required for an alien, previous to admission, has been five years,&mdash;which
is also the present requirement (1913). The present law (passed in 1906)
requires also a two years' previous "notice of intention," and excludes all
who cannot "speak" English (unless homesteaders), all polygamists, and all
who disbelieve in "organized government." Some States, however, permit
aliens to vote after receiving their "first papers,"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, after making the
preliminary "declaration of intention," before a clerk of court. The final
admission rests with a judge,&mdash;who <i>may</i> make his examination of the applicant
rigid or a mere matter of form. The power has been sometimes abused
for political purposes, both in excluding and in admitting unfit aliens.</p></div>

be next in succession, and after him the Speaker of the House. In 1886 (Jan.
19), this undesirable law was supplanted by a new one, placing the succession
(after the Vice President) in the following order: Secretary of State, Secretary
of the Treasury, Secretary of War, Attorney-General, Postmaster-General,
Secretary of the Navy, Secretary of the Interior. Cannot the student see on
what ground these officers are named in this order? Cf. <i>American History
and Government</i>, &sect; 215 and note. This provides securely against any interregnum,
and (what is almost as important) against a transfer by accident to an

was fixed by the First Congress at $25,000. This amount remained unchanged
until 1871, when it was made $50,000. In 1909, the salary was raised to
$75,000. Large allowances are made also, in these latter days, for expenses of
various sorts,&mdash;one item of $25,000 for instance, for traveling expenses,&mdash;which
is the reason the salary is commonly referred to as $100,000.</p></div>
